Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 31 of 116

Should the Company fail to pay the Termination Fee by 16 May 2017, the Claimants
will seek an additional award declaring the Company liable for and requiring the
Company to pay EUR 2,040,000 plus interest (to be assessed) plus costs.”

131. However, in subsequent submissions, the Claimants withdrew the relief related to the

termination of the MSA and the termination fee:

“The Claimants, on reflection, accept that [the] 1 April 2016 [termination] notice was
valid when given, as the privatization was under way, which is sufficient for the
purposes of clause 8.4. It makes sense that it is possible to give notice in advance to
take effect at the time the privatization is scheduled to complete.”*

“Since it is accepted that the MSA was terminated on 30 June 2016, by virtue of the
notice of 1 April 2016, the Claimants no longer claim the termination fee of €2.04
million.”

132. In their Statement of Reply, the Claimants sought the following relief:

“The Claimants deny that the Respondents are entitled to any relief. The Claimants’
claims are well founded and costs should be ordered in favour of the Claimants.”!”

133. Inthe Claimants’ Witness Submission, the relief was as follows:

“In conclusion, it is submitted that the Tribunal should award the Claimants
€16,197,806.09 plus VAT at 20%, and RSD 100,536,504 by way of management fee
for May and June 2016, in damages or debt. If the correct privatisation bonus turns
out to be higher, the Claimants will claim the higher sum.

The Claimants will also claim interest on the sums due, in accordance with Serbian
law. Calculations will be provided in due course.

Further or alternatively the Claimants claim declarations as appropriate as per
paragraphs 160, 165, 167 and/or 168 above.

The Claimants also claim costs, including the Tribunal’s expenses and the Claimants’
legal costs.”"!

134, The same relief was sought in the Claimants’ Rebuttal Witness Submission” and

Post-Hearing Brief,” with the following addition concerning the Claimants’ relief of interest:

“Under LCIA Rules 26.4: ‘The Arbitral Tribunal may order that simple or compound
interest shall be paid by any party on any sum awarded at such rates as the Arbitral

Tribunal decides to be appropriate (without being bound by rates of interest practised
by any state court or other legal authority) in respect of any period which the Arbitral
Tribunal decides to be appropriate ending not later than the date upon which the
award is complied with.’ HPK therefore claims an appropriate award of interest.
Under MSA 5.2.1, ‘the Service Provider may charge interest at the rate of the official
legal default interest rate in line with the Governing Law.’ As stated on the website of
the National Bank of Serbia, the default interest rate is the key policy rate plus 8% and
the key policy rate was 4% from 07.07.16, then 3.75% from 07.09.17, then 3.5% from
09.10.17 to date. HPK claim simple interest on all their claims at the above rates for
the period 30.06.16 (30.05.16 for the May management fee), to date of payment. At
01.01.18 this will total €3,026,562 accruing at €5,317 daily thereafter. We submit
such rate is the agreed rate and is appropriate. We do not know if this approach will
be disputed but, if for any reason it is not accepted by the Tribunal, we submit that at
the least a high commercial rate (c. 9% to reflect Serbian borrowing costs) would be
appropriate and interest should then be awarded on a compound basis with quarterly
rests,”"4

B. RESPONDENTS’ REQUEST FOR RELIEF

135. The Respondents request the following relief:

“The Respondents request the Tribunal to (i) dismiss Claimants’ Claim in its entirety
as unfounded; and (ii) order the Claimants’ to jointly and severally reimburse the
Respondents for the full amount of their costs related to this Arbitration, including the
costs of representation and other related costs.”'5

Vv. FACTS

136. This section sets out some of the undisputed facts that constitute the framework for
the present dispute. It is not an exhaustive summary of all facts. Further relevant and

disputed facts are discussed in detail in the Tribunal’s decision in Section VI below.

A. BACKGROUND

137. The dispute relates to a steel mill in the town of Smederevo, in the central region of
the Republic of Serbia, founded in 1913. From 2003 to 2012, United States Steel
Corporation was the ultimate owner of the company running the steel mill."* In 2012, the
Republic of Serbia (i.e. the First Respondent) acquired the shares in the company running the
steel mill for USD 1.7 The company was renamed Zelezara Smederevo D.O.0., i.e. the

Second Respondent. At that time, the Company was in a difficult financing position."

138. In 2014, the First Respondent announced that it would privatise the Company. It
invited bids, and entered into negotiations, but ultimately the attempt to privatise the

Company failed."

139. Instead, in 2015, the First Respondent decided to secure professional management
services for the Company to increase the chances of a privatisation. The Second Claimant, a
Dutch company providing “management services in the steel production industry”?
participated in, and ultimately won, the bidding process, which led to the conclusion of the
MSA, as described in further detail below. The Second Claimant specifically incorporated
the First Claimant, a Serbian company, in order to provide management services to the

Company.”!

B. NEGOTIATION AND CONCLUSION OF THE MSA

140. On 20 February 2015, the Second Respondent invited bids for the provision of
management services on an interim basis to privatise at a later date.2? On 6 March 2015, the
Second Claimant submitted its bid,” and the Parties entered into negotiations during the
month of March 2016. Among others, a negotiation meeting took place on 16 March 2016,

which has been transcribed in writing (the “Negotiation Transcript”).

141. On21 March 2015, the Parties concluded the MSA.2> The MSA’s ultimate purpose

was to have the Company’s business privatised.” Recital A to the MSA provides that:

“The RoS wishes to enter this Agreement:

(a) in recognition of, and in order to secure for the Company to benefit of the Service
Provider’s experience and management expertise according to the terms of this
Agreement;

(b) in order to restructure and establish the long term viability of the Company.”””

142. Clause 3.1.1 of the MSA stipulates that “this Agreement is to serve as an interim

solution until the Company is privatized.”

143. On 22 April 2015, the Parties executed the closing and takeover protocol (the

“Closing and Takeover Protocol”) and the MSA entered into force.”

144. Under the MSA, the First Claimant was to manage the Company as Chief Executive
Officer.*° While the First Claimant was in charge of the daily business of the Company, its
authority was subject to (i) obtaining the co-signature of the Officers For Government
Relations (the “OFGR”) appointed by the First Respondent; and (ii) the supervision by the
supervisory board of the Company, with two members being appointed by the First Claimant

and three members being appointed by the First Respondent.*!

Cc. PIKARO CONTRACTS

145. The Company concluded various contracts with Pikaro s.r.o. (“Pikaro”), an affiliate

of the Claimants.

146. On 22 April 2015, as part of the Closing and Takeover Protocol, the Company entered
into a “Frame Contract of Sale” with Pikaro concerning the purchase and supply of raw

materials for the Company’s steel production (the “RMA”).*?

147. On 21 May 2015, the Company and Pikaro concluded a frame contract according to
which Pikaro, as an agent, would sell the Company’s steel products to end-producers

(“Pikaro Sales Contract”).*

D. PRIVATISATION AND TERMINATION NOTICES

148. At some point in 2015, the Chinese HeSteel Group (“HeSteel”) became interested in
acquiring the Second Respondent. A data room for the acquisition was started and various

meetings and visits took place at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016.

149. On 1 April 2016, the Respondents sent a termination notice to the First Claimant, by
which they sought to terminate the MSA under Clause 8.4 of the MSA on the basis that “the

procedure for privatisation had begun” (the “First Termination Notice”).**

150. On 18 April 2016, HeSteel and the Second Respondent entered into a sale and
purchase agreement by which HeSteel purchased certain assets of the Second Respondent via

a newly founded company (the “Privatisation Agreement”).

151. On the same day, the First Claimant issued a pro forma invoice “in anticipation of the

Privatisation Bonus becoming due on completion of the Privatisation.”°*

152. On 25 June 2016, the Second Respondent sent the Claimants another termination
notice (the “Second Termination Notice’) based on “allegations that the [First Claimant]
had not complied with certain provisions of the MSA,” as well as a separate notice

terminating the RMA with Pikaro.**

153. On 30 June 2016, the Privatisation Agreement closed and the privatisation was

completed (the “Privatisation”).”

VI. TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

154. Having carefully considered the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal decides as follows,

addressing in turn the questions:
a. whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the dispute;

b. whether the MSA was validly terminated by the Respondents and a

termination fee is due to the Claimants under Clause 8.3.2 of the MSA;

c. whether a privatisation bonus is due under Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA, and if so,

how much and by whom;

Clause 3.2.5 of the MSA;

e. whether interest is due;
f. whether any other requests are well-founded; and
g. which Party bears the costs of this arbitration.

A. TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the present dispute is based on Clauses 16 and 17

of the MSA.”

156.

157.

158.

Clause 16 of the MSA reads as follows:

“DISPUTE RESOLUTION

16.1 Prior to resorting to remedies pursuant to clause 17, the Parties will attempt to
promptly resolve a Dispute in good faith through negotiations.

16.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all discussions regarding the Dispute shall be
conducted without prejudice to the rights of each of the Parties and shall be conducted
between the authorised representatives of the Parties. If such Dispute is not resolved
within 30 (thirty) days or within a time period prescribed by a later written agreement
between the Parties, such Dispute is to be settled according to remedies in clause
17

‘Dispute’ is defined in the MSA as:

“any dispute, controversy, claim or disagreement arising directly or indirectly under,
out of, in connection with, or in relation to this Agreement (or the subject matter of
this Agreement) including, without limitation, any dispute, controversy, claim or
disagreement relating to the existence, validity, interpretation, construction,
performance, enforcement or termination of this Agreement.”?

Clause 17 of the MSA provides as follows:

“CHOICE OF LAW AND JURISDICTION

Governing Law.

17.2 Any Dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any
question regarding its existence, validity or termination, which has not been resolved
through negotiation pursuant to clause 16 within 30 (thirty) days after the occurrence
of such Dispute, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the
London Court of International Arbitration Rules, which Rules are deemed to be
incorporated by reference into this clause.

17.3 The London Court of International Arbitration shall act as both, the
administrative body and appointing authority and shall consist of three arbitrators.
The Service Provider and Bidder shall have the right to jointly nominate one arbitrator
and the Company and RoS shall have the right to nominate by joint signature, one
arbitrator and the two party-nominated arbitrators shall jointly nominate the third
arbitrator who shall act as a chairman. The place of arbitration shall be London,
England. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. All
disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the effective substantive laws of
Republic of Serbia being the Governing Law.

17.4 Any award shall be binding, final and enforceable before a tribunal possessing
jurisdiction.

17.5 Each Party agrees to be bound by all and any awards or decisions of the
arbitration tribunal appointed pursuant to this clause whether or not it took part in the
arbitral proceedings provided that it was given notice of such proceedings in
accordance with the provisions of this clause. This shall also apply to any decisions
relating to procedural matters.

17.6 The Parties waive any rights of application of appeal to any court or tribunal of
competent jurisdiction to the fullest extent permitted by law in connection with any
question of law arising in the course of an arbitration or with respect to any award
rendered in accordance with this clause.

17.7 The Parties agree that the arbitral award may be enforced against the Parties to
the arbitration proceedings or their assets wherever they are located or may be found
and that a judgment upon the arbitral award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.”

As noted above, none of the Parties has raised any objections regarding the

constitution or jurisdiction of the Tribunal.“

160.

The Tribunal decides that the dispute falls within the arbitration agreement in Clauses

16 and 17 of the MSA. For the avoidance of doubt, and to the extent necessary, the Tribunal

decides that the Respondents have waived any pre-requisite to arbitration such as negotiation

under Clauses 16 and 17.2 of the MSA.

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 38 of 116

161. In light of the above, the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction to hear the present

dispute.

B. TERMINATION OF MSA AND TERMINATION FEE

162. Initially, the Claimants sought declaratory relief that “the purported termination of the
MSA by the [Second Respondent] was invalid.”** The Claimants further argued that they
were entitled to terminate the MSA and that, as a consequence, the Second Respondent had

an obligation to pay a termination fee to the Claimants under Clause 8.3.2 of the MSA.**
163. Subsequently, the Claimants withdrew those arguments and relief:

“The Claimants, on reflection, accept that [the] 1 April 2016 [termination] notice was
valid when given, as the privatization was under way, which is sufficient for the
purposes of clause 8.4, It makes sense that it is possible to give notice in advance to
take effect at the time the privatization is scheduled to complete.”*”

“Since it is accepted that the MSA was terminated on 30 June 2016, by virtue of the
notice of 1 April 2016, the Claimants no longer claim the termination fee of €2.04
million.”**
164. The Respondents, at the Hearing, suggested that the Claimants’ could not withdraw
these claims, unless all Parties agreed.” The Respondents further requested that the Tribunal

decide these points with prejudice.”

165. While the Tribunal is unconvinced about the Respondents’ argument that a change in
the Claimants’ arguments and relief requires a formal agreement by all Parties, the Tribunal
decides these points, for the avoidance of doubt, on the basis of the Parties’ common ground

in their submissions.

166. As stated above, on 1 April 2016, the Respondents sent the First Termination Notice

to the First Claimant.*! The First Termination Notice reads as follows:

07342691, has begun on 4 March 2016, under the number JP 1/16 (hereinafter:
Procedure of Privatization) hereby inform you of the following:

According to Article 8.4. of the Management and Consultancy Services Agreement,
concluded on 21 March 2015, (hereinafter: the Agreement), in the event of
successfully conducted the Procedure of Privatization the Agreement has to be
considered as terminated upon the expiration of a period of 90 (ninety) days of receipt
of this Notice or the successful completion of the Procedure of Privatization,
whichever comes later.”
167. It is uncontested that the First Termination Notice was validly made and took effect
on 30 June 2016. On this basis, the Tribunal therefore decides that (i) the Respondents
validly terminated the MSA; and (ii) no termination fee is due by the Respondents to the
Claimants under Clause 8.3.2 of the MSA. The question as to when the termination of the
MSA took effect (either based on the First or Second Termination Notice) will be addressed

below.*

Cc. PRIVATISATION BONUS

168. The Claimants’ claim that the Respondents must pay the privatisation bonus pursuant
to Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA,°* which provides that “the Service Provider shall be entitled to a
bonus fee in case any privatization of the Company that occurs within 5 (five) years [...] in
the amount equal to 30% of the acquisition price of the Company’s stake achieved through
such privatization procedure but in no event lower than USA 10,000,000.00 (ten million
dollar).”*

169. The Respondents contest that the privatisation bonus is due under Clause 3.2.9, on the
basis that the MSA was terminated by the Second Termination Notice on 25 June 2016, i.e.

before the privatisation closed and thus before the privatisation bonus became due.*”

170. As noted above, it is common ground between the Parties that, absent the Second
Termination Notice, the MSA would be terminated on 30 June 2016 based on the First

Termination Notice.®* It is also undisputed that, absent the Second Termination Notice, the

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 40 of 116

privatisation bonus would be due pursuant to Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA. The Respondents

confirmed this at the Hearing:

171.

“THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. Let me, then, maybe ask my subsequent question; absent
any later termination with the second Termination Notice, is it also your case that the
privatisation bonus would be due on the basis of the first termination.

MR PAVIC: If -- well, if first termination is the one, and the second termination
doesn’t produce immediate effect, then, of course, absent second termination then
the bonus is due. That was our case from the very beginning, that we were on the
course for termination and the bonus there.”

“MR JACOBS: So if we were to say that the second Notices were invalid, for
whatever reason, whether they didn’t go through the proper procedures or because
they were in breach of good faith, or whatever the reason may be, then you accept the
first Notice is a valid notice and the privatisation bonus would be due from the
company?

MR PAVIC: That is exactly what we have been submitting from the very beginning.
That is our secondary argument. The first line of argumentation is that we have
privatisation bonus which is not due to the second Termination Notice.”

The Parties’ dispute thus turns around the question whether the MSA was validly

terminated earlier than 30 June 2016 based on the Second Termination Notice, and whether

therefore the Privatisation Bonus was not due.

172.

1. Validity and Effect of the Second Termination Notice

According to the Respondents, the Second Respondent validly terminated the MSA.

by the Second Termination notice on 25 June 2016, by which the termination took effect

immediately." The Second Termination Notice reads as follows:

“Having in mind that [the First Claimant] (hereinafter: HPK) did not fulfill certain
provisions of the Management and Consultancy Services Agreement dated on 21
March 2015 (hereinafter: the Agreement), we hereby inform you that, pursuant to
Article 8.1. of the Agreement, the [Second Respondent] (hereinafter: the Company)
has unilaterally terminated the Agreement by the decision of the Assembly of the
Company dated 25 June 2016 which we hereby enclose to this Notice.

The reasons for the termination, among others, are:

+ [B]reach of the Article 3.1.5.1 due to the fact that the Net Working Capital, starting
from 30 November 2015, until the date of sending of this Notice, constantly amounted
less than USD 80,000,000 (eighty million dollars);

+ Breach of the Frame Contract of Sale No. 151 by the company Pikaro s.r.o, Bellova
3, 040 0 I Kosice, Slovak Republic, statistic number: 36674079, as a supplier, due to
which the subject agreement has been canceled as well, what represents the additional
reason for termination of the Agreement;

+ Entering into the agreement with a related parties [sic] without prior approval and
notification of the Supervisory Board of the Company;

+ Breaches of the non-compete obligations defined by the Agreement by HPK;

+ Expiration of the Insurance Policy issued in accordance with Article 2.3.7 of the
Agreement;

+ Breaches of clauses defined in chapter 3 and chapter 4 of the Agreement by HPK;

+ Breaches of the provisions of the Serbian Companies Law (“Official Gazette RS”,
No. 36/2011, 99/2011, 83/2014 - another law and 5/2015) as well as other applicable
laws and regulations;

+ Breaches of other obligations stipulated in the Agreement.”

173. In this arbitration, the Respondents have relied on two series of alleged breaches of
the MSA to justify the validity and immediate effect of the Second Termination Notice: first,
a breach of Clause 8.1.2 MSA;® and second, various breaches of the MSA which according
to Article 127 of the Serbian Law of Obligations would have immediate effect.

174. The Claimants argue that neither of these alleged breaches occurred or justified the
Second Termination Notice with immediate effect;® and that in any event the Second

Termination Notice was invalid as a matter of corporate law.

175. The Tribunal will first look at the alleged breach of Clause 8.1.2 of the MSA, before

turning to the other alleged breaches.

“8.1 The RoS and/or the Company may (but shall not be obligated to) terminate this
Agreement by a notice to the Service Provider and the Bidder upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any of the following events:

8.1.1 the Service Provider or Consultants or members of the Supervisory Board
nominated by the Service Provider as applicable, fail to comply with any of
their material obligations in this Agreement (including fulfilment of the KPis as

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 43 of 116

179. According to the Respondents, (i) Pikaro breached the RMA in various ways; (ii) the
Second Respondent therefore validly terminated the RMA; and (iii) as a consequence of the

termination of the RMA, the Respondents validly terminated the MSA pursuant to its Clause
8.1.2.7

180. According to the Claimants, (i) Pikaro did not breach the RMA, and in any event not
in a material manner; (ii) the termination of the RMA was invalid; and (iii) only a material
breach of the RMA could be a valid cause for terminating the MSA pursuant to its Clause
8.1.2.

181. The Tribunal will first address the question of interpretation of Clause 8.1.2 of the
MSA, before turning to the alleged breaches and termination of the RMA.

a) Interpretation of Clause 8.1.2 MSA

182. It is common ground between the Parties that Clause 8.1.2 of the MSA allows the
Respondents to terminate the MSA in certain cases of breach or termination of the RMA. In
particular, it is undisputed that Clause 8.1.2 comes into play if the RMA was “breached in
any material manner by a respective supplier”, i.e. here: Pikaro.” However, the Parties
disagree as to whether a termination of the RMA by the Respondents can trigger Clause 8.1.2,

or whether only a termination by the supplier, i.e. Pikaro, can do so.

183. According to the Claimants, Clause 8.1.2 MSA applies only if the RMA is terminated
by the supplier, ie. Pikaro.* Among other things, the Claimants argue that “[o]therwise, the

Company could manipulate Article 8.1.2 by terminating the [RMA] in order to give an unreal
basis to trigger 8.1.2.”

184. According to the Respondents, Clause 8.1.2 MSA applies if the RMA is terminated,
irrespective of which party sought to terminate the RMA.” Among other things, the
Respondents argue that this follows from the literal interpretation of Clause 8.1.2. According
to the Respondents: “[t]he qualification ‘by the respective supplier’ only applies to the [last]
scenario [i.e.] breach of the [RMA] in a material manner [...] The text of the Article 8.1.2 of

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 44 of 116

the MSA cannot be interpreted in any other manner.” In this context, the Respondents
further argue that, in any event, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine the
validity of the termination of the RMA since the RMA contains a separate and different

arbitration agreement.”

185. The Tribunal finds with the Claimants on this point. In interpreting Clause 8.1.2, the

Tribunal took into account several factors.

186. First, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the mere wording of Clause 8.1.2 does not
resolve the issue. Looking at the text of Clause 8.1.2, it is impossible to determine whether
“by a respective supplier” relates merely to a possible breach of the RMA, or also to its

termination.

187. Second, and accordingly, the Tribunal takes into account the aim and context of
Clause 8.1.2 MSA. The evidence suggests that the RMA was an important precondition for
the Respondents when entering into the MSA.” The Respondents wanted to ensure that the
Company had sufficient raw materials, since supply problems had created issues in the past,
i.e. before the MSA took effect. As explained by Mr Kamaras, the Company has experienced
recurrent issues with the procurement of raw materials prior to the MSA. It was therefore
essential for the Respondents that the supplier of the raw materials could not terminate the
RMA during the MSA’s contractual term.*' Accordingly, it was the termination of the RMA
by the supplier that was essential when looking at the effects on the MSA. Had the Parties
wanted a termination of the RMA by either party to result automatically in a termination of
the MSA, they could have included a clear provision to this effect. The Tribunal notes that
the RMA indeed contains such a provision for the reverse situation. According to Clause
10.1 of the RMA, the RMA “shall automatically cease to exist with expiry or termination of
[the] MSA.”*

188. In light of this, the Tribunal finds that Clause 8.1.2 of the MSA supposes a
termination of the RMA by the supplier, i.e. Pikaro, for such RMA termination to be able to

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 45 of 116

trigger the termination of the MSA. Accordingly, the mere fact that the Second Respondent
allegedly terminated the RMA is not, in and of itself, sufficient ground under Clause 8.1.2 of
the MSA to justify the termination of the MSA. The Tribunal therefore does not need to
decide whether the RMA termination was valid or not (and incidentally, does not need to
decide whether it has jurisdiction to decide this point). Instead, the Tribunal must determine
whether Pikaro “breached in any material manner” the RMA for such breach to trigger
Clause 8.1.2 of the MSA.

b) Alleged Breaches of the RMA

189. The Respondents allege that Pikaro breached the RMA by not providing the level of
financing required thereunder.® In particular, the Respondents argue that Pikaro did not
provide the Company, i.e. the Second Respondent, with the agreed 60 days deferred payment
conditions (the “Deferred Payment” issue), as well as with the overall credit of 20 million
(the “Credit” issue) pursuant to Clauses 2.4 and 2.6 of the RMA.™ The Claimants contest

these breaches.**
190. The relevant provisions of the RMA are as follows. Clause 2.4 RMA stipulates that:

“Tn accordance with the [MSA] [...] the Seller [i.e. Pikaro] shall guarantee to the
Buyer [i.e. the Company] a credit amounting to USD 20,000,000.- (in words: twenty
million US dollars) upon delivery of Goods in form of 60 days deferred payment
conditions [...].”°°

191. Moreover, Clause 2.6 RMA provides that:

“The payment shall be effected as follows: 100% of the value of the Goods shall be
paid by the Buyer [i.e. the Company] 60 days after the date of loading the Goods by
the Producer, advised by the Seller [i.e. Pikaro], based on invoice issued by the Seller
[sic].”8”

192. ‘Goods’ are defined as “raw materials defined in single Contract(s) produced by the

Producer and delivered by the Seller [i.e. Pikaro] on the basis of the single Contract.”**

c) Deferred Payment Issue

193. The aim of the Deferred Payment was to provide the Company with a better cash-
flow. Prior to the RMA (and MSA), the Company had to pre-pay its goods in many instances
which detrimentally affected its cash-flow.” During the negotiation of the MSA, the
provision of Deferred Payment terms was discussed as a vital issue for the Company.” The
Claimants agreed that it would be able to provide the Company with the Deferred Payment

terms.’! The idea was to provide “breathing space” for the Company.”

194. Ina simplified manner, the chronology of the supply chain of raw materials from their

producer to the Company typically looks as follows:

a. Producer loads and sends the goods to Pikaro;

b. Goods are on their way from the producer to Pikaro (the “In-Transit Time”);
c. Pikaro receives and reviews the goods;

d. Pikaro sends the goods to the Company and invoices the Company;

e. Company receives the goods;

f. Payment of goods is due according to invoice; and

g Company pays Pikaro for the goods.

195. While the Parties are essentially in agreement regarding the above, they disagree
about (i) when the Deferred Payment period starts to run; (ii) when the Deferred Payment
period ends; (iii) how long the Deferred Payment period is; and (iv) whether Pikaro breached

the Deferred Payment period. The Tribunal will look at these points in turn.

qd) Start Date of Deferred Payment

196. According to the Claimants, the Deferred Payment starts before the goods are loaded
by the producer. Indeed, the Claimants argue that the relevant starting date is when the

Company would have “otherwise” had to pay for the raw materials, i.e. in absence of the

RMA with Pikaro.* The Claimants explain that “[p]rior to the [RMA], the Company was
required to pre-pay for raw materials before loading.”®> The Deferred Payment granted by
Pikaro should therefore, according to the Claimants, be calculated from the time when the
Company would previously have had to pay for the goods. The Claimants’ expert, referring
to Mr Pavol Vrchovinsky’s testimony, assumed that this should be 5 days prior to the date of
the loading of the goods.”

197. The Respondents argue that the pre-payment date prior to the RMA is irrelevant:
according to the Respondents the calculation of the pre-payment date remains unclear and
unspecified and, in any event, was not agreed upon by the Parties either in the RMA or
otherwise.® Instead, the Respondents’ expert calculated the starting date of the Deferred

Payment period as from the date of the shipment of the goods from Pikaro to the Company.”

198. The Tribunal finds with neither Party on this point. Rather, it is clear from Clause 2.6
of the RMA that the relevant moment in time for the Deferred Payment period to start is
when the goods are loaded by the producer. Clause 2.6 RMA clearly states that “the Goods
shall be paid by the Buyer [i.e. the Company] 60 days after the date of loading the Goods by
the Producer, advised by the Seller [i.e. Pikaro], based on invoice issued by the Seller
[sic].”!° Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Deferred Payment period starts to run when

the goods are loaded and sent by the producer to Pikaro.

(2) End Date of Deferred Payment

199. According to the Claimants, the Deferred Payment’s end date is the actual payment
date of the invoice,'*! whereas the Respondents argue that the relevant end date is the
payment due date on the invoice.! The Respondents argue that the invoice due date is the

only relevant date since “[o]nce an invoice falls due, the debtor is in default [and thus] [i]t is

no longer financed and its payment is no longer deferred — the debtor is now late with

payment and may be charged default interest.’"

200. The Tribunal finds with the Claimants on this point for a number of reasons. First,
Clause 2,6 of the RMA refers to the “payment” of the goods by the Company after 60 days,
and not to any invoicing period or due date. Second, this is also in line with the ultimate
aim of the RMA which was to provide a credit or “breathing space” to the Company in order
to ease its cash-flow.'”> What matters in this context is the actual payment and not the formal
due date, Third, it is important to keep in mind the economic reality that Pikaro was
controlled by the Service Provider.'® Accordingly, the Service Provider was the one who
issued the invoice (though Pikaro) and was also responsible for its payment by the Company
(as its manager), subject to obtaining the co-signature of the OFGR. Therefore, the
Respondents’ argument that a debtor faces adverse consequences, including late payment
interest, in case an invoice is not settled in time, is unrealistic and thus unconvincing in this

context.

201. In light of the above, the Tribunal decides that the relevant end date for the Deferred
Payment period is the actual payment date of the goods by the Company.

(3) Length of Deferred Payment

202, According to the Claimants, the 60 days Deferred Payment period provided for in
Clauses 2.4 and 2.6 of the RMA has been altered in subsequent contracts between Pikaro and

the Company.'’ More specifically, the Claimants argue that:

a. the RMA, as a framework agreement, foresaw and allowed the parties (i.e.
Pikaro and the Company) to enter into subsequent implementation agreements in form

of single contracts regarding the sale of raw materials;!”

b. Pikaro and the Company entered into several of those single contracts which

(i) provided for shorter invoicing periods (e.g. 5 days, 30 days); (ii) were each time

approved by the Company’s supervisory board and by the Respondents’ OFGR;"° and

(iii) superseded the Parties’ previous agreement in the RMA;!" and

Cc. the RMA did not prohibit shorter invoicing periods since (i) Clause 1.1
allowed for the parties to “otherwise agree[] in writing”;'” and (ii) Clause 1.3

provided that the single contracts were an “integral part” of the RMA.'"

203. According to the Respondents, the single contracts’ invoicing periods could not
change the requirement of a Deferred Payment period of 60 days as per Clauses 2.4 and 2.6
of the RMA."

204. The Tribunal finds with the Respondents on this point for two independent reasons.

205. First, the single contracts deal with the invoicing period, i.e. the date when the
payment of the goods is due."> As determined above (and according to the Respondents’
own argument), however, the relevant moment for the Deferred Payment period is not the
invoice due date, but the date of the actual payment.''® As such, the provisions in the single
contracts dealing with the invoicing period and payment due dates are irrelevant in the

Tribunal’s view for its analysis of the Deferred Payment.

206. Second, and in any event, the Parties could not deviate in the single contracts from the
Deferred Payment provisions contained in Clauses 2.4 and 2.6 of the RMA. Clause 1.1 of the
RMA clearly provides that “[t]he terms of the Frame Contract shall also apply to all single
Contracts [...]” and goes on that “[uJ]nless agreed otherwise by the Parties in writing, any
terms and circumstances related to the purchasing or buying of documents used in
connection with the Contract(s) that are not in compliance with the Frame Contract will
become null and void, and only the terms of the Frame Contract shall be valid.”""" While
the Tribunal finds the reference to “purchasing or buying of documents” somewhat unclear,
Clause 1.1 establishes a clear hierarchy between the RMA framework contract and the single

contracts, in the sense that the former’s terms prevail over the latter’s. The addition “[u]nless

agreed otherwise by the Parties in writing” logically therefore does not refer to any
amendments via the single contracts, but only to an amendment of the framework agreement,
ie. the RMA itself. Furthermore, the Claimants cannot rely on Clause 1.3 of the RMA."*
Clause 1.3 provides that “/qJuantities and prices shall be determined under the single
Contract(s), mutually signed by both parties” and “[t]he same present integral part of this
Frame Contract.” Therefore, when looked at fully, it becomes clear that Clause 1.3 applies
to quantities and prices and not to invoicing or payment terms which are dealt with in

Clause 2 of the RMA.

207. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Deferred Payment period, which runs
from the date of the loading of the goods by the producer to their actual payment by the
Company, must be 60 days as per Clauses 2.4 and 2.6 of the RMA.

(4) Breach of Deferred Payment

208. Having thus established the Deferred Payment period, the subsequent question is

whether Pikaro breached the Deferred Payment period in the case at hand.

209. It is common ground between the Parties (and the Tribunal agrees) that for the
purposes of Clauses 2.4 and 2.6 of the RMA not every single payment need to comply with
the 60 days requirement, but rather that Pikaro provides the 60 days Deferred Payment
conditions to the Company as an average. This was confirmed by Mr Milosevic at the

Hearing:

“Q Second. Yes. You first said that Mr Kamaras is
claiming that -- sorry, just a second -- yes -- that the
credit period is to be calculated as an average of sixty
days from the date of company would otherwise have to
pay raw materials, and that -- is it -- first of all,

comment this formula, average sixty days, et cetera, as
the method of calculating this sixty days deferred
payments, and whether Mr Kamaras correctly interpreting
your agreement in regard the method, so whether you
agreed to that or not.

A Well, it is the average that we were looking at, average
credit period of sixty days.”'°

210. The Parties, however, disagree on how to calculate such average and have submitted

significant expert evidence on this point.'?!

211. The Respondents argue, based on their expert’s reports, that the 60 days period on
average was not met.'? However, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents’ expert did not
calculate the average Deferred Payment taking into account the relevant start and end date.
The Respondents’ expert calculated the average days between the “shipment date”! (which
he explained was the date when Pikaro shipped the goods to the Company‘) and the invoice

due date.

212. The Claimants’ expert has provided calculations on the average days between the
loading of the goods by the producer and the actual payment by the Company.”° However,
the Tribunal has hesitations as to the accuracy of the figures provided by the Claimants’
expert, in particular concerning the In-Transit Time (i.e. the time between the moment when
the producer sends the goods to Pikaro and the moment when the goods are received by
Pikaro).!° The Tribunal is of the opinion that the Claimants’ assumed length of the In-
Transit Time (21 days) is not supported by evidence. This figure has not been independently
verified by the Claimants’ expert, as Mr IIlet stated in his report:

“T am therefore unable to validate the 21 day figure and am instructed that it is
accurate.”!?7

213. Rather, the 21 days figure has been put together by the First Claimant’s employee
Mr Pavol Vrchovinsky,' partially relying on estimates from his colleagues.’ Indeed, the
Claimants’ expert admitted during the Hearing that the 21 days In-Transit Time were

incorrect and based his updated calculations on a different figure.”

214. Nevertheless, even leaving aside these hesitations, the calculations by the Claimants’

expert show that the Deferred Payment period was not 60 days on average. In his expert

report, Mr Illet calculated that the average time from the loading of the goods to the payment
date was 59 days (taking into account invoices issued during the entire timeframe of the
RMA)"! or 63 days (taking into account only invoices issued after September 2015)."* He
then updated these figures at the Hearing to 54 days in the first scenario, and 58 days in the
second scenario.? Accordingly, in both scenarios, on the Claimants’ own figures, the

average number of days is below 60.

215. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that the only scenario under which the
Claimants’ expert calculated an average that is higher than 60 days was one that took into
account unpaid invoices.'* These unpaid invoices constitute only a fraction of the total
number of relevant invoices, and the number of unpaid days was on average 472 days
according to Mr Illet’s assumptions." Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that adding these
unpaid invoices would unduly affect the weighted average and should therefore remain

excluded.

216. In light of the above, the Tribunal is satisfied that Pikaro did not provide the 60 days
Deferred Payment required under Clauses 2.4 and 2.6 of the RMA. While this constitutes a
breach of the RMA, the Tribunal now needs to determine whether the RMA was breached “in

a material manner” so as to trigger Clause 8.1.2 of the MSA.

(5) Material Breach

217. According to Clause 8.1.2 of the MSA, it applies if the RMA is “breached in any

material manner by a respective supplier.”
218. ‘Material’ is defined in Clause 1.1. of the MSA as follows:

““Material’ means in respect of any fact, object, claim, liability or event which could
cause, would result or lead directly or indirectly to a significant impact on, inter alia,
the business, assets or operations of the Company exceeding EUR 500,000 (five
hundred thousand euros) or equivalent in other currency, except those disclosed
within this Agreement.”!3”

219. The Parties have made no submissions on the meaning of the word ‘material’ in
Clause 8.1.2 MSA. The Tribunal notes, however, that the Parties have commented on the

meaning of the word ‘material’ in Clause 8.1.1 MSA:

a. according to the Respondents, the definition in Clause 1.1 does not apply to
Clause 8.1.1 since the term ‘material’ is not capitalized,"* noting furthermore that the
Serbian version of Clause 8.1.1 uses a different word for ‘material’ than in Clause 1.1,

and that this word means ‘substantive’ (as opposed to procedural);!? and

b. the Claimants contest the Respondents’ interpretation and state that Clause
8.1.1 MSA requires a material breach (rather than a breach of a material obligation),
while at the same time accepting that the definition in Clause 1.1. does not apply to

the non-capitalized term ‘material’ in Clause 8.1.1 MSA."

220. Similarly, Clause 8.1.2 uses the word ‘material’ without it being capitalized. The
Tribunal thus finds that the non-capitalized word ‘material’ in Clause 8.1.2 MSA does not
refer to the definition in Clause 1.1. MSA, which requires a specific threshold. In the
Tribunal’s view, the obvious and literal meaning of “in a material manner” thus applies: i.e.
in a manner that matters or is significant. Mere formal breaches or breaches that are

insignificant should therefore be excluded from the application of Clause 8.1.2 MSA.

221. In this context, it is important to note that the Deferred Payment condition was not an
end in-and-of itself. Rather, as detailed above, it was a means to provide the Company with a
financial ‘breathing space.’"' The provisions of the RMA make clear that the ultimate goal
was to provide the Company with a credit line through the use of the Deferred Payment
conditions. Indeed, Clause 2.4 RMA refers to a “credit amounting to USD 20,000,000.- [...]
in form of 60 days deferred payment conditions.”"? The Deferred Payment issue is therefore

linked to the Credit issue, in the sense that the former is meant to provide the latter.

222. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the breach of the 60 days Deferred Payment is
material only if, as a result thereof, the 20 million credit target is not met. In other words, in

order to decide whether the 60 days Deferred Payment conditions qualifies as a breach in a

“material manner” for the purposes of Article 8.1.2 MSA, the Tribunal needs to look at the 20

million Credit issue.

d) Credit Issue

223. The relevant provision concerning the Credit issue is Clause 2.4 of the RMA which

provides as follows:

“Tn accordance with the [MSA] [...] the Seller [i.e. Pikaro] shall guarantee to the
Buyer [i.e. the Company] a credit amounting to USD 20,000,000.- (in words: twenty
million US dollars) upon delivery of Goods in form of 60 days deferred payment
conditions [...].”"°
224. The Parties have filed significant submissions and evidence on this point." They
disagree, among other things, about (i) the form of the Credit; (ii) the correct methodology to
calculate the Credit; and (iii) whether the Credit was provided by Pikaro. The Tribunal will

look at these issues in turn.

dd) Form of Credit

225. There is dispute among the Parties as to how Pikaro should provide the 20 million
Credit to the Company.

226. The Claimants argue that the Credit in Clause 2.4 RMA refers to a “financial credit”
and does “not require a level of physical stocks in the pipeline.” In any event, according to

the Claimants, the 20 million does not represent a “mandatory minimum.”!°

227. According to the Respondents, Clause 1.1 of the MSA requires that the Company be
provided with raw materials of at least USD 20 million in value, looking at the physical

levels of the goods in stock and in transit.”

228. In the Tribunal’s view there are two separate, albeit related, issues.

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 55 of 116

229. The first issue is whether the Credit is understood as a “financial credit” or requires a
certain level of actual physical goods to be in stock at, or in transit to, the Company. On the
one hand, Clause 1.1 of the MSA refers to the “right of the Company to [...] have in any
moment of the validity of the Raw Material Agreements on a Company premises a stock of
delivered raw materials and / or raw materials ordered and in transit to the Company of a
minimum USD 20,000,000 (twenty million dollars) value.”“* On the other hand, Clause 2.4
of the RMA provides that “the Seller [i.e. Pikaro] shall guarantee to the Buyer [i.e. the
Company] a credit amounting to USD 20,000,000.- (in words: twenty million US dollars)

upon delivery of Goods in form of 60 days deferred payment conditions [...].”"””

230. This apparent conflict between these two provisions of the MSA and RMA is
however easily resolved if one looks at the relationship between the MSA and the RMA.
Indeed, the conclusion of the RMA was a precondition for the closing of the MSA pursuant
to Clause 2.3.3 of the MSA:

“The Closing of this transaction shall occur when the following preconditions are met:
[...] [t]he Raw Materials Agreements are duly signed in a form reasonably
satisfactory to all Parties [...].”!°
231. It is for that purpose that Clause 1.1 of the MSA contains a definition of “Raw
Material Agreements.” By signing the Closing and Takeover Protocol, the Parties attested to

the fact that they were satisfied with the terms of the RMA as entered into:

“The Parties acknowledge that the Raw Material Agreement has been signed with the
terms and conditions as well as in a form satisfactory to the Parties and as defined by
the MSA.”"5!
232. The Closing and Takeover Protocol further refers to the “value of the Raw Material
Agreement” and the “funds of USD 20,000,000 (twenty million dollars)” in this

context.!5?

233. In light of the above, the Tribunal is satisfied that Clause 2.4 MSA is the relevant

provision on point and it requires a certain level of financing, not a physical level of stocks.

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 56 of 116

234. The second issue is whether the amount of 20 million is understood to be a minimum
or maximum. The Claimants suggest the latter, noting that the amount “is only a credit, not a
mandatory minimum,” and that “[Clause] 1.1 of the MSA [...] only envisages a right toa
credit, not some mandatory minimum.”'* However, Clause 2.4 requires that “the Seller [i.e
Pikaro] shall guarantee to the Buyer [i.e. the Company] a credit amounting to USD
20,000,000.- (in words: twenty million US dollars) [,..]."!%* Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s
view, this means that this was the minimum amount of credit that Pikaro was required to
make available to the Company, It was, however, for the Company to determine whether or
not it wished, at any particular point in time, to utilise the full amount of the credit that was to
be made available. It is possible to envisage situations in which the Company would not
wish to utilise the credit. For example, there was a ramp-up period in the initial phase of the
RMA, and neither party expected that the full amount of USD 20,000,000 credit would be
utilised immediately, even though it was potentially available. However, apart from the
ramp-up period, there was no evidence which indicated that the Company did not wish to use

the full 20 million credit during the currency of the RMA.

235, In sum, the Tribunal finds that Clause 2.4 of the RMA requires that Pikaro provide the
Company with a credit or financing line of at least 20 million in form of the Deferred

Payment conditions, discussed above.

(2) Method of Calculation

236. The Parties are also in dispute as to how to calculate the Credit amount and have

provided extensive submissions and evidence on this point.'**

237. In essence, the main disagreement between the Parties is whether the appropriate
method of calculation is to take into account only Pikaro’s receivables under the RMA (the
“Gross Financing Approach”) or the overall financial position between Pikaro and the
Company, looking at other contracts entered into between them (the “Net Financing

Approach”).

238. Indeed, as detailed above,

a. on 22 April 2015, Pikaro and the Company entered into the RMA which deals

with the supply of raw materials to the Company; and

b. on 21 May 2015, Pikaro and the Company entered into the Pikaro Sales
Contract according to which Pikaro, as an agent, sells the Company’s products to end-

producers. '*”

239. According to the Claimants, the Gross Financing Approach is the appropriate method
of calculation.'** The Claimants do not agree with the Respondents’ attempts to take into
account receivables from the Pikaro Sales Contract: they argue that this “confuse[s] two
totally different things” because the RMA and the Pikaro Sales Contract are different

contractual relationships.'”

240. According to the Respondents a form of Net Financing is the appropriate approach.’

Among other things, the Respondents argue that

a. the Gross Financing Approach artificially isolates the RMA from the overall
Pikaro/Company financial relationship and is therefore “completely unfounded and

divorced from reality;’"!

b. Pikaro and the Company entered into several set-off agreements which show
that they “did not consider the two arrangements [i.e. the RMA and the Pikaro Sales

Contract] to be separate and unrelated;”' and

c the two arrangements were connected since “the claims of Pikaro towards end-
buyers for [the Company]’s products were utilized to obtain means to finance [the

Company].”'*

241. The Respondents also refer to an “effective gross financing” approach which is

calculated, according to the Respondents’ expert as a Gross Financing Approach “decreased

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 58 of 116

by the amounts of Pikaro’s accounts payables due.”! However, as the Respondents’ expert
explained at the Hearing, the “effective gross financing” approach is another form of net

financing:

“MR JACOBS: Can I just ask something? On your effective
gross financing, that does involve a netting-off of

amounts owed one way against amounts owed the other way.
A: That’s correct. Yes.

MR JACOBS: I am just a bit puzzled, why is it gross
financing? Why isn’t that a species of net financing?

Is there something about --

A: That is a very good question. I would like to feel I

came up with the term, but the term was defined to me

about what needed to be done and that was the term that

was given to me so I would like to say I came up with it

and J made it up but I am afraid that wasn’t the case,

so the key thing is you are quite right, it is about
understanding the netting-off between the payables and

the receivables due date, so you are right on that

point. I would say, and I agree with you, it is

probably more of a net -- it is probably in the camp of

the net calculation.”

242. The Tribunal finds with the Claimants on this point. The Tribunal is unconvinced that

any form of Net Financing (including “effective gross financing”) is required under Clause
2.4. of the RMA.

243. _ First, this clearly results from the provisions of the RMA itself. According to Clause
2.4. of the RMA the Credit was to be provided “in form of 60 days deferred payment
conditions”! on the “Goods”, with are defined as “raw materials [...] produced by the
Producer and delivered by the Seller [i.e. Pikaro] [...].”"” Accordingly, it is clear from the
provisions of the RMA that the Credit is to be calculated on the basis of the raw materials
delivered under the RMA from Pikaro to the Company. The RMA does not refer to the fact
that the Credit should be calculated taking into account receivables from other contractual
arrangements (such as the Pikaro Sales Contract) or the overall financial position between the

Parties.

244. Second, the Tribunal notes that at the time the RMA was entered into (i.e. April
2015), the Pikaro Sales Contract did not exist yet: it was only negotiated and entered into one
month later (i.e. May 2015). At that later moment in time, the Service Provider suggested
that the Company could sell its products to the end costumers via Pikaro so that it could
benefit from more favourable financing conditions. Mr Boris Milosevic testified at the

Hearing to this effect:

“Sometimes in May, end of May, June, Pikaro suggested, Mr Kamaras, Pikaro, HPK,
suggested that, basically, because of the practical limitations and issues with respect to
factoring of the receivables that Zelezarah as towards foreign suppliers, foreign
customers in Serbia, that basically we transfer a part of them, which are on deferred
payment terms, to Pikaro in order for Pikaro to utilize their own credit lines in
Unicredit, Slovakia, and as a result of that, to be able to faster collect cash with that
collection of cash to purchase even more inventories at the better and favourable
conditions [...].”"

245. The Parties anticipated this to be a temporary solution, as again Mr Boris Milosevic

testified at the Hearing:

“On that discussion, on those Supervisory Board, I remember I clearly said to
everyone that basically this is a temporary solution for until Zelezara opens its own
subsidiary abroad, and that is how we all understood each other.”!
246. It is therefore unconvincing that in the RMA, entered into at a time when the Pikaro
Sales Contract did not even exist, the parties agreed to include receivables from that Pikaro

Sales Contract in the calculation of the Credit terms.

247. Once the Pikaro Sales Contract was entered into, and once it became apparent that it
would not be a temporary solution, as initially planned, but a long-term arrangement, the
Respondents could have sought to re-negotiate the definition of Credit under the RMA.

There is no evidence before the Tribunal that such renegotiation took place.

248. The Tribunal notes in this context that Mr Boris Milosevic seems to suggest that Mr
Peter Kamaras accepted a Net Financing Approach at a meeting that took place on 24 January

2016. In his first witness statement, Mr Kamaras stated:
“Finally, in January 2016, Mr. Kamaras openly verbally stated on the meeting held on

Sunday 24 January 2016 in KPMG offices on which Mr. Ivica Kojic, Mr. Bojan

Bojkovic, Mr. Nenad Mijailovic, Mr. Milun Trivunac and myself attended that he is
unable to provide this financing to Zelezara as envisaged by the MSA.”!°

He also noted in his second witness statement:

“T always go back to 24th January 2016 when Mr. Kamaras admitted to the close
audience that he does not have the necessary USD 20 million of financing to provide
to Zelezara.”!”!

At the Hearing, he testified in cross examination as follows:

“Pikaro said on 24 January 2016 to Mr Ivica Kojic, Chief of Staff of the Prime
Minister, Mr Nenad Mihailovic, State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Mr Milan
Trivunac, Assistant Minister in the Ministry of Economy, Mr Bojan Bojkovic,
member of Supervisory Board of Zelezara and to myself, a member of Supervisory
Board of Zelezara, that he does not have a possibility to be in a position that 20
million net exposure is towards him, that he cannot return those receivables, and that
he cannot have 20 million of financing towards us. That is what he said on the
24th."

While the Tribunal notes that there is no corroborative evidence that Mr Kamaras

made those statements, in any event, the Tribunal is not satisfied that such a remark could

result in a change of the definition of Credit in the RMA which, as stated above, only takes

into account the raw materials and receivables under this agreement.!?

252.

In sum, the Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the correct approach to calculate the

Credit amount under the RMA is a Gross Financing Approach.

253.

(3) Breach of Credit

Having determined that the Gross Financing Approach is the correct approach to

calculate the Credit amount pursuant to Clause 2.4 RMA, the Tribunal now needs to

determine whether the Credit was breached.

254.

As a preliminary remark, the Parties are in agreement that there has to be some

flexibility at the initial stages of the RMA. An initial ‘ramp-up’ period was necessary since

the Credit was to be provided in form of the 60 days Deferred Payment conditions, as

discussed above.'* As explained by Mr Kamaras:

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 61 of 116

“Tn fact, credit of over $20 million was provided beginning in August 2015 after the
initial ramp-up and then throughout the relevant period apart from November 2015
when it fell slightly below due to the lessening of orders.”"*

255. This was also confirmed by Mr Boris Milosevic at the Hearing:

“We have understood quite clearly that it cannot be 20 million on Day I that you
pool and receive the inventories, raw materials, in the value of that, that it will take
time for the goods, for the raw materials to arrive to Smederevo, and for them to be
put into the Production.”"”*

256. However, the Parties are in disagreement as to the times when the Credit was met or

breached:

a. according to the calculations of the Claimants’ expert, the Credit was breached

at certain times in 2015, but not since December 2015;!” and

b. according to the calculations of the Respondents’ expert, the Credit was

breached at times, but not in January/February and May/June 2016."
257. The Tribunal notes that it has reservations on both experts’ calculations.

258. On the one hand, the Respondents’ expert did not include in its calculation any In-
Transit Time. As noted above, such time was not included in his calculation of the Deferred
Payment,'” and consequently also not in the calculation of the Credit in form of Deferred

Payment.'*° Mr Qureshi confirmed this at the Hearing:

“THE CHAIRMAN: Before we move on, just really to clarify,
I think it is very clear from this outline or timeline,

when you referred to shipment date, you always referred
to shipment date by Pikaro to Zelezara to the company.
A: By Pikaro to Zelezara. Yes.

Okay, in terms of the comparison of the two

financing periods, just to make it very clear, in terms

of what our start and end date is, I was saying, or

I was instructed to assume that it was a shipment date
compared to Mr Ilett saying the date of Pikaro’s
pre-payment, the end date I say is, or have been

259. However, since the Tribunal found above that the Deferred Payment period includes
the In-Transit Time, such In-Transit Time must also be included in the calculation of the

Credit (provided in form of the Deferred Payment).

260. On the other hand, while the Claimants’ expert included the In-Transit Time, he did
so on the basis of an assumption that this In-Transit Time would be 21 days.’ As discussed
above, Mr Illet could not independently verify this assumption and admitted at the Hearing
that it was wrong.'® There is also some unclarity as to whether all categories included by Mr
Illet in his calculations are indeed goods ordered by, or in transit to, the Company (via
Pikaro).'*

261. Irrespective, however, of the Tribunal’s comments as to the calculations provided by
the Parties’ experts, the Tribunal is satisfied that even on the Respondents’ calculations'**
(and in any event on the Claimants’ ones'**) the Credit was met in June 2016. Indeed, under
any given gross financing approach, the Credit was above 20 million in June 2016, as

illustrated by Mr Qureshi at the Hearing:'*”

262. Accordingly, at the time when the Respondents filed the Second Termination Notice
on 25 June 2016, there was no breach of the Credit requirement under Clause 2.4 RMA, and
thus also no material breach of the Deferred Payment condition under Clause 2.6 RMA.

263. It is however that moment in time that is relevant under Clause 8.1.2 of the MSA to
assess whether a material breach of the RMA occurred and thus justifies a termination of the
MSA. Indeed, Clause 8.1.2 MSA clearly provides that “[t]he RoS and/or the Company may
(but shall not be obligated to) terminate this Agreement [...] upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any of the following events: |...] if the Raw Materials

Agreements [...] are terminated or breached in any material manner by a respective supplier

[..Jos
264. The Respondents’ counterarguments on this point are not convincing.

265. The Respondents argue first that the requirement “upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of” only applies to Clause 8.1.1 (which provides for a correction time) and not to

Clause 8.1.2 (which provides for a termination with immediate effect).'”

266. This interpretation, however, is not supported by the language of Clause 8.1 of the

MSA which makes no such distinction; instead the requirement “upon the occurrence and

during the continuance of” is found in the introduction of Clause 8.1 and thus applies

irrespectively to everything that follows, i.e. Clause 8.1.1 and 8.1.2:

267.

“8.1 The RoS and/or the Company may (but shall not be obligated to) terminate this

Agreement by a notice to the Service Provider and the Bidder upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any of the following events:

8.1.1 the Service Provider or Consultants or members of the Supervisory Board

nominated by the Service Provider as applicable, fail to comply with any of
their material obligations in this Agreement (including fulfilment of the KPis as
set out by the Business Plan or other obligations set out by the Business Plan
and/or any other strategic documentation) and do not correct such failure within
120 (one hundred twenty) days of the date of a notice requiring correction from
the non-defaulting Party;

8.1.2if the Raw Materials Agreements cease to be valid and legally binding before

the expiration of third anniversary of the Closing or the Raw Materials
Agreements are terminated or breached in any material manner by a respective
supplier;

in which cases the Company shall not be obliged to pay neither the Termination
Fee nor the Privatization Bonus to the Service Provider and will retain the right
on indemnification from the Service Provider and/or the Bidder for of all
damages suffered.”!°

The Respondents further argue that the Serbian version of the MSA would lead to a

different interpretation since the Serbian version:

268.

“makes it clear that the termination may be made where there is “occurrence or
continuation” (in Serbian: ‘nastupanja ili trajanja’). Given that the transaction
lawyers who drafted this document were all Serbian,166 Serbian text is a ‘hidden
anchor language’ of the contract — the native language of its drafters. Therefore, it is
relevant and useful interpretation tool for any ambiguities which might arise in respect
of the nominally prevailing English text.”""!

However, as just shown above, there is no ambiguity in the English text of Clause

8.1.2 of the MSA. Therefore, pursuant to the language provision in Clause 15.3.1 of the

MSA, the English version prevails in case of discrepancy or inconsistency:

“This Agreement has been executed in Serbian and English language. In case of any
discrepancy or inconsistency between these two versions, the English version shall
prevail.”

269. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that at the relevant moment in time, i.e. on 25
June 2016, no material breach of the RMA existed that could have triggered a termination of

the MSA with immediate effect according to Clause 8.1.2 of the MSA.

3. Other Breaches of the MSA

270. The Respondents further allege a number of other breaches as bases for the Second

Termination Notice. According to the Respondents, the Claimants:

a. failed to maintain the required level of net working capital of 80 million for
the Company pursuant to Clause 3.1.5 of the MSA (the “New Working Capital”
issue);!

b. failed to fulfil the requirements in relation to related party arrangements
pursuant to Clause 4.2 of the MSA (the “Related Party Arrangement” issue);!*

c. failed to fulfil the requirement of a professional insurance indemnity pursuant
to Clause 2.3.7 of the MSA (the “Professional Insurance” issue);!%°

d. breached their non-competition obligations pursuant to Clause 11 of the MSA
(the “Non-Competition” issue);'°

e. failed to provide the required skilled managers for the Company (the
“Managers” issue);!”” and

f. obstructed the privatisation and closing of the Privatisation Agreement (the
“Obstruction of Privatisation” issue).!%

271. The Claimants contest that any of these breaches occurred.'” In any event, according
to the Claimants, a 120 days correction period would have been necessary pursuant to Clause
8.1.1 MSA.2°

272. The Respondents in turn argue that the 120 days correction period was unnecessary
and that they could terminate the MSA with immediate effect according to Article 127 of the
Serbian Law of Obligations (the “LO”).””

273. The Tribunal will address the 120 days correction period in Clause 8.1.1 MSA, and
whether Article 127 LO allows immediate termination instead, before looking at the alleged

breaches in turn.

a) 120 Days Correction Period (Clause 8.1.1 MSA)

274. Clause 8.1.1 of the MSA provides as follows:

“The RoS and/or the Company may (but shall not be obligated to) terminate this
Agreement by a notice to the Service Provider and the Bidder upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of any of the following events: [...]

the Service Provider or Consultants or members of the Supervisory Board nominated
by the Service Provider as applicable, fail to comply with any of their material
obligations in this Agreement (including fulfilment of the KPis as set out by the
Business Plan or other obligations set out by the Business Plan and/or any other
strategic documentation) and do not correct such failure within 120 (one hundred
twenty) days of the date of a notice requiring correction from the non-defaulting
Party.”

275. It is thus clear from the simple language of Clause 8.1.1 that any termination of the

MSA based on a breach of “material obligations” therein requires that (i) the non-defaulting

party send a “notice requiring correction;” and (ii) the defaulting party does not correct the

default within 120 days from such notice.

276. It is undisputed that the Respondents did not send a notice requiring correction, and in
any event not before the Second Termination Notice. Rather, the Respondents argue that
they did not have to wait for the 120 days correction period to end, but could terminate the

MSA with immediate effect according to Article 127 LO,”” discussed in the next section.

b) Immediate Termination (Article 127 LO)

277. Article 127 LO provides as follows:

“A party to an agreement may terminate the agreement without leaving the debtor a
subsequent time limit for performance, should the debtor’s conduct indicates (sic) that
it will not perform his obligation even during the course of subsequent time limit.”

278. The Respondents make, among other things, the following submissions:

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 67 of 116

“Article 126 of the Law on Obligations stipulates that, as a rule, a creditor wishing to
terminate an agreement must provide appropriate subsequent period for the debtor
to perform. However, this general rule is subject to three exceptions,

Two exceptions deal with situations where timely performance is key. First, no
additional time period need be given where the contract sets a deadline for
performance of an obligation and it is evident that one party will not fulfil it (Article
128 of the Law on Obligations), Second, where timely performance is an essential
element of the contract, expiration of deadline rescinds the contract automatically,
unless creditor opts to keep it afoot (Article 125 of the Law on Obligations).

The third exception, Article 127 of the Law on Obligations, deals with obligations
where deadline for performance was either not set or its observance is not of essential
nature. Even in such situations, a party is nevertheless entitled to terminate the
agreement without leaving an additional period to the debtor, if one can conclude
Jrom the debtor’s behavior that it will not fulfill its obligation even if given
subsequent period to perform. The purpose of this article is to dispense of the need
to give additional period where giving it would be useless.”

The Respondents also refer to the following commentary:

“Tt seems to us that there is space for a broad interpretation of [Article 127 LO].
Debtor’s conduct may be such that it has explicitly stated that it would not perform
the contract. However, even in cases when it can be inferred from debtor’s certain
conduct that it would not perform the contract, creditor is not obliged to leave it the
appropriate subsequent time limit, but can instead terminate the contract by a simple
statement without leaving such a time limit. Therefore, debtor’s conduct should be
understood so as to include its direct actions —a statement by which it declines the
contract performance, as well as its indirect actions, by which its intention not to
perform the contract can be established in a certain manner. By the same token, it
would suffice to establish that the debtor is unable to perform the contract within
the appropriate subsequent time limit.”?°

The Claimants make, among other things, the following submissions on this point:

“On 127, [...] The material demonstrates the principle that if a breach or prospective
breach is not so serious that it deprives the creditor of the purpose of the contract, it
cannot be grounds for termination. This is established by Perovic Commentary [...].
So for 127, the prospective breaches which the debtor’s conduct make obvious must
be so serious as fo prevent achievement of the purpose of the contract within a
reasonable deadline for performance {...]. To use another phrase, the prospective
breaches must go to the root of the contract. 131’s rule that insignificant breaches
cannot justify termination is not exhaustive: many breaches that are more than
insignificant will not be enough under 127. This is consistent with principle. Serbian
law aims to preserve contracts and permitting termination for breaches which were not
so serious that they defeated the purpose of the contract, nor fundamental, would

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 68 of 116

contradict this policy. (3) Uncertainty as to whether the debtor will perform is not
enough: this must be obvious from his conduct {...]. (4) Termination is not possible
under 127 where the 120 day notice provision which the parties have agreed in 8.1.1
can and should be used (outside e.g. refusal to perform with insufficient time available
to give notice).”°7

“So the correct analysis is that in the main Perovic commentary (1995) [...]: to justify
termination the breach must be so serious as to undermine the purpose of the
contract: in effect it must be fundamental; partial performance which yields,”?
281. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that on the essential points the interpretation
of Article 127 LO is clear.

282. First, Article 127 LO constitutes an exception to the general rule in Article 126 LO
that a party who wishes to terminate an agreement must provide an “appropriate subsequent
period” for the debtor to perform, i.e. to correct the non-performance (the “Correction
Period”). In the present case, the Parties agreed in Clause 8.1.1 of the MSA that this

“appropriate subsequent period” or Correction Period would be 120 days.

283. Second, a party may exceptionally terminate an agreement with immediate effect, i.e.
without a Correction Period. Article 127 uses the terms “without leaving the debtor a
subsequent time limit for performance.””” This exception applies if “the debtor’s conduct
indicates that it will not perform his obligation even during the course of subsequent time
limit." Article 127 LO therefore makes clear that one needs to (i) look at the debtor’s
conduct; and (ii) assess whether the debtor would perform the contract during the
“subsequent time limit.” That “subsequent time limit” is the Correction Period, i.e. the time
limit the debtor would normally have been given to correct the non-performance. Indeed, a
Correction Period is unnecessary if “the debtor’s conduct indicates that it will not perform his
obligation” during such time. In sum, as stated by the Respondents, “[t]he purpose of this
article is to dispense of the need to give [an] additional period where giving it would be

useless,”?"!

284. Having thus determined the relevant legal standard, the Tribunal will now assess the

Respondents’ conduct, looking at the alleged breaches in turn.

c) Net Working Capital (Clause 3.1.5.1 MSA)

285. Clause 3.1.5.1 of the MSA provides as follows:

“The Service Provider commits: [...] to at all times keep the Net Working Capital of
the Company not lower than USD 80,000,000 (eighty million dollars).”?

286. ‘Net Working Capital’ is defined in the MSA as:

“Current Assets reduced by all:

(a) liabilities to domestic or foreign suppliers for purchases of any goods, assets or
services;

(b) liabilities to banks or other institutions for working capital loans, maintenance
loans, capital expenditure loans, leases, overdrafts, etc.;

(c) liabilities to government for unpaid taxes, contributions, custom duties or any
other fiscal liabilities;

(d) liabilities to employees for salaries, bonuses and any other remunerations
(excluding employee benefits calculated under IAS 19);

(e) accrued expenses;
(f) liabilities to customers for advance payments received.”?

287. Itis common ground between the Parties that the Net Working Capital of the
Company has been below 80 million since October 2015.7" Notwithstanding, the Claimants
argue that Article 3.1.5.1 of the MSA was not breached because, according to the Claimants,
the drop of the Net Working Capital was due to (i) an event of vis major?' — an argument that
the Claimants later withdrew;7" (ii) the Respondents’ misrepresentations about the
Company’s financial information when the Parties entered into the MSA;?"” and (iii)

subsequent conduct of the Respondents.?!*

288. The Tribunal is of the opinion that it need not decide these points. Even assuming a
breach of 3.1.5.1 of the MSA (since it is established that the 80 million threshold was not

met), the Tribunal finds that such breach would not lead to a termination with immediate

effect. Indeed, the Tribunal finds that, regarding the New Working Capital, it is not
established that the Claimants’ conduct was such that it would not perform the contract

during the “subsequent time limit.”

289. First, the Claimants’ witnesses have testified that, if requested, there could have been

several ways to address the New Working Capital:

“A shareholder capital contribution (taking no more than one week);
A pledge of the fixed and current assets of the business in order to secure a long-term
loan from a commercial bank ([...], which would have taken c. 90 days);

Securing from HeSteel a long-term advance payment (either to the Company or to the
supplier) for the purchase of raw materials (taking between 30 and 60 days provided
all approvals were given); and

Balance sheet adjustments of payment terms for the purchase of raw materials and the
sale of end products — payment terms for raw materials delivered by Pikaro could
have been extended to 370 days, with the effect that the payables would have been
reclassified in the Company’s accounts as long-term (and hence not forming part of
the calculation of NWC). At the same time, payment terms for end products
purchased by Pikaro from the Company could have been extended to 355 days (hence
the receivables would remain current assets and form part of the calculation of NWC).
This would have taken c. 60 days depending on the actual raw material flow.2”

290. Second, as discussed above, the purpose of Article 127 LO was to provide an
exception to the normal requirement of a Correction Period if it became clear, from the
debtor’s conduct, that such Correction Period was useless because the debtor would not
perform.”° As also noted above, in the present case, the Parties agreed on a Correction
Period of 120 days.”! At the time when the Second Respondent filed the Second Termination
Notice, ie. on 25 June 2016, the MSA had only 5 more days to run, i.e. until 30 June 2016,
because of the First Termination Notice.” Under these circumstances, there is no purpose to
apply Article 127 LO, which is to allow a party to forego the agreed 120 days Correction
Period, if it is clear that the other party would not perform the contract during that time.
Here, the performance of the MSA became moot after only 5 days due to its termination on
the basis of the First Termination Notice, and the issue of non-performance during the 120

days Correction Period is thus irrelevant.

291. Third, the Respondents’ counterarguments on this point are inapposite.?? In
particular, the Respondents’ argument that the New Working Capital threshold had not been
met since November 2015 cannot justify a different conclusion. Quite to the contrary,
because the Respondents were aware since November 2015 that the New Working Capital
was below the 80 million threshold, there was no reason or new development that would

justify invoking the exception of Article 127 LO only days before the end of the MSA. |

292. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the drop in the New Working Capital,
even assuming it constituted a breach of Article 3.1.5.1 of the MSA, could not justify a

termination with immediate effect by the Second Termination Notice.

d) Related Party Arrangements (Clause 4.2 MSA)

293. It is undisputed amongst the Parties that the Company, in June 2015, entered into a
contract with GLS Steel Distributors Ltd (“GLS”) which is ultimately owned by two
individuals (Mr Nasser and Mr Fruchter) who also hold a 20% participation in the First

Respondent.”

294. The Respondents argue that GLS was a “Related Party” pursuant to the MSA and that
the Claimants should have used the required approval mechanism under Clause 4.2 of the
MSA.”5

295. According to the Claimants, among other things, (i) at the time the Company entered
into the contract with GLS, Mr Nasser and Mr Fruchter had not yet acquired any stake in the
First Respondent (this only occurred in September 2015); (ii) it was public knowledge that
Mr Nasser and Mr Fruchter held a participation in the First Respondent; and (iii) the contact
with GLS was not a “Related Party Arrangement” within the meaning of the MSA.”

296. Clause 4.2. of the MSA provides as follows:

“The Service Provider recognises that Related Party Arrangements need to be effected
on a transparent, arm’s length basis and in the best interests of the Company and the
Service Provider hereby agrees that, prior to effecting any Related Party Arrangement,
the Service Provider shall:

[4.2.1] provide full disclosure of and provide all supporting documents relating to
such Related Party Arrangement to the Supervisory Board.

[4.2.2] obtain the co-signature of the OFGR (such co-signature not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); and

[4.2.3] check whether there are any legal or regulatory requirements that might
prevent such arrangements, generally or only in certain territories or circumstances,
notify the Supervisory Board of the existence of any such requirement. The Service
Provider shall not enter into any such agreement before the said requirements are
met.””227

Moreover, there are several definitions in Clause 1.1 of the MSA that are relevant.
“Related Party Agreement” is defined as:

“any arrangement, transaction or agreement (or any modification of any arrangement,
transaction or agreement) involving the Company or any subsidiary or any other
Affiliate thereof or the business or properties thereof, on the one hand, and the Service
Provider or any Affiliate or the business or properties thereof (whether as a party
thereto or receiver or provider of any accommodation, consideration, goods or
services), on the other hand.””8

“Affiliate” means:

“in relation to any person be it legal entity or natural person, (a) any other person
directly or indirectly Controlling or Controlled by or under common Control with,
such a person, or (b) any (i) Officers, Officer, trustee or beneficiary of such a person,
(ii) spouse, parent, sibling or descendant of any person described in (i) or spouse,
parent, sibling or descendant of the person directly or indirectly Controlling, or which
is under common Control with, such person, and (iii) any trust (or its equivalent under
any Governing Law) for the benefit of any person described in (i) and (ii).”?”

“Control” is defined as:

“directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of shares/stake, by contract or
otherwise (i) the right to have the majority of the voting rights exercisable at a
shareholders meeting (or its equivalent) of the person concerned or (ii) the right to
appoint, and/or remove and/or direct/procure the decision making process of other
corporate bodies (including but not limited to, supervisory boards, managing boards
or equivalent thereof of the person concerned), and the terms “Controlled” and
“Controlling” shall be construed accordingly.”

In light of the above, the Tribunal hold as follows.

227 MSA, Exhibit CF-3.

228 MSA, Clause 1.1, Exhibit CL-3.
229 MSA, Clause 1.1, Exhibit CL-3.
230 MSA, Clause 1.1, Exhibit CL-3.

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 73 of 116

302. First, the fact that Mr Nasser’s and Mr Fruchter’s participation in the First Respondent
was allegedly a matter of public knowledge is not determinative: the approval procedural
under Clause 4.2 of the MSA requires that the First Respondent “provide all supporting
documents relating to such Related Party Arrangement to the Supervisory Board” and does

not provide for an exception in case of public information.

303. Second, the Claimants’ argument that Mr Nasser and Mr Fruchter acquired their
participation only three months after the Company entered into the contract with GLS is
inapposite. Otherwise, it would be easy to circumvent the approval procedural of Clause 4.2
of the MSA.

304. Third, however, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the GLS contract qualifies as a
“Related Party Arrangement” in the sense of the MSA and thus that Clause 4.2 applies in the
case at hand. According to Clause 1.1 of the MSA a “Related Party Agreement” is defined as
an “arrangement, transaction or agreement” between the Company on the one hand and the
“Service Provider [i.e. the First Claimant] or any Affiliate or the business or properties
thereof” on the other hand.#! The question is therefore whether GLS qualifies as an
“Affiliate” of the First Claimant. “Affiliate” pursuant to Clause 1.1 of the MSA requires
some form of direct or indirect or common “Control.”? “Control” in turn is defined as “(i)
the right to have the majority of the voting rights exercisable at a shareholders meeting (or
its equivalent) of the person concerned or (ii) the right to appoint, and/or remove and/or
direct/procure the decision making process of other corporate bodies (including but not
limited to, supervisory boards, managing boards or equivalent thereof of the person

concerned),”

305. The Respondents have not established that Mr Nasser and Mr Fruchter have either a
majority of the voting rights in, or the right to procure the decision-making process of, the
First Claimant.?* In light of this, the Tribunal finds that it is not established that the contract
with GLS was a “Related Party Arrangement” in the sense of the MSA and thus required the
approval procedural of Clause 4.2 of the MSA.

e) Professional Insurance (Clause 2.3.7 MSA)

306. The Respondents argue that the First Claimant failed to provide a professional
insurance indemnity pursuant to Clause 2.3.7 of the MSA.*° The Claimants deny such

breach.
307. Clause 2.3.7 of the MSA requires that:

“[t]he Service Provider has executed an agreement on professional insurance
indemnity in a form approved by the RoS and the Company with minimum insurance
coverage of EUR 5,000,000 (five million euros).”*7
308. Itis undisputed between the Parties that the First Claimant provided an insurance
policy for professional indemnity cover for the period from 20 April 2015 to 20 April 2016,
and that the policy was renewed for the period of 20 April 2016 to 20 April 2017.

309. The Respondents argue that the policies were not in accordance with Serbian
insurance law since they were not issued by a Serbian-based insurance company.”” However,
the evidence shows that the policy was indeed provided by a Serbian insurance company,
namely Wiener Stadtische A.D.O Belgrade."

310. The Respondents further argue that the second policy was never delivered to the
Company, and that such non-delivery defeated the purpose of Clause 2.3.7 of the MSA.

311. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the non-delivery of the insurance policy constitutes
in and of itself a breach of Clause 2.3.7 of the MSA, which does not refer to any delivery
obligation. In any event, even assuming such alleged breach of Clause 2.3.7 of the MSA, the
Respondents did not establish how the Respondents’ conduct would justify, pursuant to
Article 127 LO, foregoing the 120 days Correction Period under Clause 8.1.1 of the MSA: if
requested, the Company could have delivered the policy within 120 days.

f) Non-Competition (Clause 11 MSA)

312. The Respondents further allege that the First Claimant and Mr Peter Kamaras
breached their Non-Competition obligations pursuant to Clause 11 of the MSA in their

contacts with HeSteel.2° The Claimants deny these breaches.”
313. Clause 11 of the MSA provides that:

“The Service Provider and the Bidder [i.e, the Claimants] hereby undertakes for the
benefit of the other Parties that, during the Term of this Agreement, the Service
Provider, the Bidder as well as members of the Supervisory Board nominated by the
Service Provider and the Consultants, shall not, and shall procure that each of its
Affiliates shall not, without the consent of the RoS:

11,1.1 carry on or be engaged or hold any direct or indirect interest in the issued share

capital of any business that operates in the steel sector, and represents direct
competitor of the Company regardless of the territory or jurisdiction;

11,1,2 provide any goods or services, or enter into, or have an interest in, any
arrangement with any third party providing goods or services, in respect of any
business that operates in the steel sector and represents direct competition of the
Company, regardless of the territory or jurisdiction;

11.1.3 cause or permit any person directly or indirectly to do any of the foregoing acts

or things in the name of or with the support of the Service Provider or the Bidder.

11.2 During a period of 2 (two) years after the termination of this Agreement, the

obligations set out in this clause 11 shall continue to exist, but shall become limited to

the European Economic Area.”

314. The Respondents make the following submissions in this context.

315. The Respondents note that they “do not contend that communication between HeSteel

and the Claimants in the course of Privatization represents a breach of noncompetition
duty.”*4° They add that “[d]ue to their role in Zelezara, Claimants had to enter into

communication with HeSteel in order to facilitate the Privatization process.”

316. However, the Respondents take issue with alleged “improper relations between the

Claimants and HeSteel,””"* namely the fact that the Claimants (i) sent a management proposal

to HeSteel on 20 April 2016; (ii) sent a draft management agreement to HeSteel on 28 June

2016;?® and (iii) appeared at a meeting on 28 June 2016 alongside HeSteel.?*!

317. Inthe Tribunal’s view, none of these actions establish a breach of Clause 11.1 of the

MSA that would justify a termination thereof on 25 June 2016.

318. First, the meeting of 28 June 2016 took place after the Second Termination Notice of
25 June 2016. Accordingly, anything that occurred during that meeting cannot justify the

termination on 25 June 2016 with immediate effect, i.e. three days prior.

319. Second, and similarly, the draft management agreement was sent by Mr Pavol
Vrchovinsky to Mr Song on 28 June 2016, i.e. after the Second Termination Notice.
Moreover, and in any event, in this draft agreement, the First Claimant offered its
management services to HeSteel for the period following the privatisation, i.e. after 30 June
2016. Indeed, the draft management agreement refers in the recitals to “[t]he closing of the
transaction envisaged under the Asset Sale and Purchase Agreement” i.e. the closing of the
Privatisation Agreement.?” Again, any action after 30 June 2016 cannot constitute a breach
of the MSA that would justify its termination with immediate effect on 25 June 2016, i.e. five

days prior.

320. Third, the management proposal, dated 15 April 2016, and sent by Mr Kamaras to
Mr Wang on 20 April 2016, concerns interim management services pending the closing of
the privatisation on 30 June 2016. In terms of the proposal, this concerns the relationship
with the Company’s “suppliers and customers”, “employees”, and “business partners”,
including preparing the “documents in compliance with Asset Sales and Purchase Agreement
(ASPA) [i.e. the Privatisation Agreement]” in view of its closing.?® It is unclear how this
could constitute a breach of Clause 11.1 of the MSA. In any event, it appears from the
evidence that the management proposal was not accepted by HeSteel and thus never came

into effect. The Tribunal thus finds that the Respondents have not established that any of

the Claimants’ actions prior to 25 June 2016 would amount to the breach of Clause 11.1 of
the MSA.

321. The Tribunal notes, for the avoidance of doubt, that it does not have to decide whether
the Claimants breached Clause 11.2 of the MSA following the termination of the MSA,
because the question before the Tribunal is whether any breach of Clause 11.1 of the MSA

would justify such termination.

g) Managers

322. The Respondents argue that the Claimants failed to provide the required skilled
Managers for the Company.’ The Claimants deny this.*° However, the Tribunal notes that
according to the Respondents, “the issues surrounding the managers appointed by HPK were
not grounds for termination of the MSA, and this was never alleged by the Respondents.”
The Tribunal therefore finds that it does not have to address this issue in the context of the

validity and effects of the Second Termination Notice.

h) Obstruction of Privatisation

323. Finally, the Respondents argue that the Claimants obstructed the Privatisation and
closing of the Privatisation Agreement, including by (i) failing to provide or obtain waiver
letters from the Company’s customers, business partners and otherwise; (ii) obstructing the
negotiation of utility contracts with the Company’s suppliers; (iii) issuing certain bills of
exchange; (iv) failing to secure the necessary level of raw materials for the steel production;

and (v) failing to provide necessary information to HeSteel.?*

324. According to the Respondents, these actions constitute breaches of the Claimants’
duty of care towards the Company pursuant to Articles 63 and 64 of the Serbian Companies

Law, to which the Claimants must abide according to Clause 3.8.1.1 of the MSA.

325. The Claimants deny that they obstructed the Privatisation process, and in any event
that this would constitute a breach under the MSA or a valid basis for the Second

Termination Notice.?°

326. The Tribunal will look at the relevant legal provisions before assessing the alleged

breaches in turn.

(1) Clause 3.8.1.1 MSA in combination with Articles 63
and 64 Serbian Companies Law

327. Clause 3.8.1.1 of the MSA reads as follows:

“The Service Provider shall owe the following duties to the Company: [...] Duty of
care (within the meaning of the articles 63 and 64 of the Serbian Companies Act).”?

328. Article 63 of the Serbian Companies Law in turn provides that:

“Persons referred to in Article 61 paragraph 1 items 4) and 5) of this Law shall carry
out their duties in that capacity in good faith, with due diligence and ina
reasonable belief that they act with the company’s best interest.

For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, due diligence shall be the level of care
which a reasonably cautious person would use if he/she had the knowledge, skills
and experience that could reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same
functions in a company.

Ifa person referred to in Article 61 paragraph 1 items 4) and 5) has certain specific
knowledge, skills or experience, such knowledge, skills and experience shall also be
taken into account for the purpose of evaluation of due diligence.

It is deemed that persons referred to in Article 61 paragraph 1 items 4) through 5) of
this Law may also base their actions on the information and opinions provided by
persons specialized in a specific filed for whom they reasonably believe they have
acted in good faith in each specific case.

A person referred to in Article 61 paragraph 1 items 4) through 5) who demonstrates
that he/she acted in accordance with this Article shall not be liable for any damage
incurred by a company as a result of such action.”*!

329. Article 64 of the Serbian Companies Law provides that:
“A company may bring legal action against a person referred to in Article 61
paragraph 1 items 4) through 5) of this Law for indemnification of any damage caused

to it by such person through a breach of the duty of care provided for in Article 63 of
this Law.”??

330. The Claimants do not contest that Articles 63 and 64 of the Serbian Companies Law

are relevant and must be complied with pursuant to Clause 3.8.1.1 of the MSA. However,

261 Exhibit RL-1 (emphasis added).

they challenge that any obstruction occurred.” The Tribunal will look at the alleged

breaches or obstruction actions in turn.

(2) Waiver Letters

331. The Respondents’ argument on this point is twofold: the Claimants failed to (i)
provide their waiver letters as part of the closing of the Privatisation; and (ii) take appropriate

steps in order to obtain waiver letters from the Company’s customers and business partners.2

332. On the first issue, the Claimants argue that there was no obligation for the Claimants
to provide any waiver letter. However, Clause 7.2(i)(d) of the Privatisation Agreement

provided as a pre-condition for the closing:

“{to provide a] termination agreement or similar document entered into between the
Seller [i.e. the Second Respondent] and HPK Management doo [i.e. the First
Claimant] confirming that the [MSA] is terminated as of the Closing Date, and that
PK Management d.o.o do not have any claim, rights or title against the Uniform
Sales Package.”?

333. Although the Claimants are not parties to the Privatisation Agreement, the First
Claimant, as manager of the Company, was aware of this pre-condition. Therefore, unduly
withholding any agreement or document under Clause 7.2(i)(d) could have constituted a

breach of the First Claimant’s duty of care vis-a-vis the Company.

334. However, it appears on the evidence that the Claimants provided assurances that were
satisfactory to HeSteel and the Privatisation closed on 30 June 2016 as planned.” Moreover,
and in any event, any above-described breach could only materialize at the closing of the
Privatisation Agreement on 30 June 2016, if the pre-condition of Clause 7.2(i)(d) was not
met. Therefore, this could not be a valid ground for the termination of the MSA in the

Second Termination Notice with immediate effect on 25 June 2016, i.e. 5 days prior.2*

265 SoR, at paras 19-21; CSub2, at para. 25.

266 Privatisation Agreement, dated 18 April 2016, Exhibit CF-10 (emphasis added).

267 It is undisputed that the Privatisation closed on 30 June 2016. SoC, at para. 46; Annex to RSub2. The fact
that the Claimants appear to have provided their waiver letters only on 1 July 2016 (see Correspondence
between HeSteel and Mr Kamaras, dated 1 July 2016, Exhibit RF-29) is irrelevant in this context.

268 See also Transcript Day 3, 86:3-6 (Mr Boris Milosevic: “HPK letter was needed before the closing not before
termination. We didn’t terminate because they didn’t provide a waiver letter. We didn’t terminate the MSA
because Pikaro hasn’t provided a waiver letter.”) (emphasis added).

-75-

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 80 of 116

335. On the second issue, Clause 4.1(iv) of the Privatisation Agreement further included as
a pre-condition of closing that the Company provide certain waivers from third parties listed
in Annex 6.” The Respondents argue that the Claimants did not take the necessary steps to
obtain those waiver letters from the Company’s customers and business partners,?” whereas
the Claimants allege that they took all necessary steps, going over and above their duties
under the MSA.?7!

336. The Tribunal finds that the evidence does not establish that any difficulty in obtaining
the waiver letters swiftly from third parties was due to the Claimants’ lack of efforts, as
opposed to the inherent difficulties in such a process.” It is however clear from the evidence
that the waiver letters from the relevant third parties (other than Pikaro) were obtained before
the closing, either on 24, 28, or 29 June 2016. The fact that the waiver letters were obtained
prior to closing indicates that efforts had been made to obtain them prior to the Second

Termination Notice. Mr Boris Milosevic testified as follows at the Hearing:

“Q Leaving aside Pikaro and HPK, all the waiver letters the
Service Provider had to get were obtained by --

ANo, that is not correct. Two of the waiver letters were
not received on the 24th. They were received only on 28
or 29 June. If so I recall well, one was Hurkovicz(?)

but please don’t keep me for the words. I really don’t
know the details. I forgot but I know, there were two
suppliers who have not signed their waiver letters until
the 24th.

Q But they were obtained by the closing.

A Yes. We have obtained them by the closing in those
hectic few days before the closing.”””

337.  Pikaro, an affiliate of the Claimants, was also one of the parties required to provide a
waiver letter pursuant to Clause 4.1(iv) of the Privatisation Agreement in combination with
Annex 6.2 This waiver letter was provided on 30 June 2016, and finalized and signed 1 July

2016.” This delay in the signature of the Pikaro waiver letter did not prevent the

26 Privatisation Agreement, dated 18 April 2016, Exhibit CF-10, and Appendix 6, Exhibit CF-41.

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 81 of 116

Privatisation from closing and, as confirmed by Mr Boris Milosevic at the Hearing, was not

the reason for the Claimants’ alleged termination of the MSA on 25 June 2016:

“Q There is not a single document in which you chase for an HPK waiver letter before
the termination.
A HPK letter was needed before the closing not before termination. We didn’t
terminate because they didn’t provide a waiver letter. We didn’t terminate the MSA
because Pikaro hasn’t provided a waiver letter.”””®
338. In light of the above, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants’ conduct with regard
to the waiver letters was not such that it would have justified a termination on 25 June 2016,
and in any event not one with immediate effect pursuant to Article 127 LO, foregoing any

Correction Period as provided for in Article 126 LO and Clause 8.1.1 of the MSA.

(3) Utility Contracts

339. The Respondents further argue that the Claimants obstructed the Privatisation and
closing of the Privatisation Agreement, by obstructing the negotiation of utility contracts
between HeSteel and the Company’s suppliers.?” More particularly, the Respondents state
that obtaining contracts with the main suppliers of the Company (e.g. electricity, gas, etc.)
was a precondition of the closing of the Privatisation Agreement, and the Claimants did not
“fulfill their tasks” in this respect since some contracts were hastily entered into shortly
before the closing.” The Respondents specifically refer to the Company’s supplier of
technical gas, Messer Tehnogas Serbia (“Messer”), and allege that the Claimants “obstructed

the conclusion of the agreement between Messer and HeSteel [...].”?”

340. According to the Claimants, they had no contractual obligation to help procure those
contracts; they nevertheless took any reasonable steps to do so; and any delay in finalizing

these contracts was not attributable to the Claimants.”

341. The Tribunal notes that obtaining contracts with certain suppliers, including Messer,
was a precondition of the closing of the Privatisation Agreement pursuant to Clause 4.1(xi)

thereof.**! Similar to the waiver letters issue discussed above,” the Claimants were not a

party to the Privatisation Agreement and thus had no contractual obligation thereunder.
However, as manager of the Company, the First Claimant had a duty of care vis-a-vis the
Company under Articles 63 and 64 of the Serbian Companies Law. Accordingly, they had to
use best efforts to help the Company fulfil the pre-conditions under the Privatisation

Agreement.

342. The Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants did not always give urgent attention to
the need to conclude a contract with Messer in the time leading up to 25 June 2016. Mr
Bode, General Manager of Messer, testified in his witness statement”® and at the Hearing that
Mr Kamaras suggested in early June that there was no urgency in negotiating the supply
contract with Messer since he did not believe that the closing of the Privatisation would
happen by 30 June 2016:

“Q Okay, in your written statement you said that you asked
Mr Kamaras about urgency of the matter knowing from
media that the closing under the privatisation contract

was scheduled for 30 June 2016. Can you tell us what

did Mr Kamaras told you on your question, what did he
answer on your question, and how was it, his reaction
about it.

A Mr Kamaras mentioned that he doesn’t believe that the
closing will happen until 30 June, that it will be in

the third quarter, even maybe later which was logical

for me at the time because we had not been very advanced
at the stage of contract conclusion and negotiation.”?*

“_,.then I guess I asked, or I asked how urgent is the
matter, since from the press I heard, on 30 June the
closing should be, and his statement was, “It is
unrealistic that that will happen on 30 June. It will
happen probably in the third quarter, maybe in the
JSourth”. That was for me very important, very important
information, because he was the side, he was for me the
party I should negotiate with, and that, for me, was --
there is no rush,”?*

343. However, the documentary evidence also shows that there were steps taken towards

the negotiation of the supply agreement with Messer. For instance, on 21 June 2016, Mr

Marcel Német, of the Company, wrote to Mr Bode and Mr Ringhofer of Messer to provide

some technical data necessary for the contract negotiation.?*

344. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ lack of urgency in relation
to Messer was not such that it amounted to a breach of the MSA, and in any event not one
that could have justified a termination of the MSA with immediate effect pursuant to Article
127 LO. The Respondents have also not established that the Claimants’ conduct was such
that it would not perform the MSA during a subsequent Correction Period and that thus any

such Correction Period was unnecessary or useless.

345. Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ actions
after 25 June 2016 (e.g. at the 28 June 2016 meeting with Messer) are irrelevant to assess

whether the termination on 25 June 2016 was validly made.

(4) Bills of Exchange
346. The Respondents argue that the Claimants obstructed the Privatisation and closing of

the Privatisation Agreement by issuing certain bills of exchange to the detriment of the

Company.’ The Claimants deny these allegations.
347. The Tribunal notes that the Respondents make the following statement:

“Although the incident surrounding bills of exchange evidences the negligent
attitude of the Claimants and their apparent lack of good faith, it was not the reason
for the termination of the MSA since this incident only came to light after the MSA
was terminated.”

348. In light of the above, the Tribunal does not need to decide this point in order to assess

whether the alleged termination of the MSA on 25 June 2016 was valid.

(5) Supply of Raw Materials

349. The Respondents argue that the Claimants obstructed the Privatisation and closing of
the Privatisation Agreement by failing to secure the necessary level of raw materials for the

steel production at the Company.”” The Claimants deny these allegations.”

350. Under the Privatisation Agreement, the full working of the two blast furnaces at the
steel factory of the Company was a pre-condition for the closing of the Privatisation.2” Mr

Kamaras stated at the Hearing that he was aware thereof:

“Q Have you been aware that Hesteel, the Chinese company,

wished to purchase a plant with two functioning blast

furnaces?

A Yes. Yes I was.”
351. This was the reason why, in May 2016, the second blast furnace was re-started after
having been out of operations since November 2015.2" In June 2016, there were two
instances in which one of the two blast furnaces had to be shut down: from 11-13 June 2016
and on 22 June 2016:

a. Concerning the 11-13 June 2016 outage, the Respondents argue that it was due
to insufficient levels of scrap, a raw material needed for the production of steel.”
According to the Claimants, the outage was initially due for maintenance reasons, but
was then “brought forward when a railroad accident led to a short-term scrap

shortage.”?°°

b. Concerning the 22 June 2016 outage, the Respondents state that it was due to
insufficient levels of coke, another raw material needed for the production of steel.?””
The Claimants argue that, while the coke levels were low, the outage was for planned

maintenance works. The Respondents contest this stating that (i) maintenance

works never require more than 24 hours; and (ii) the required maintenance works had

already been done earlier that month, on 11 June 2016.2”
352. The Tribunal finds as follows on the raw materials issues.

353. On the one hand, it is satisfied that the blast furnace outages at the Company were
partly due to the First Claimant: as manager of the Company, the First Claimant was
responsible to ensure the necessary levels of raw materials to run the steel production and
failed to do so at all given times. For instance, Mr Mihailovic testified at the Hearing that the
coke levels at the Company on 21, 22, and 23 June were too low to allow a safe steel
production.*” Mr Kamaras admitted this in an email of 21 June when he wrote “[w]e have to

shut down the blast furnaces for 60 hours because of the lack of coke.”3!

354. On the other hand, the evidence shows that the outages were also, at least partially,
due to external factors. The earlier outage from 11-13 June was, at least partially, due to a
railroad accident;3” the later outage on 22 June was, at least partially, due to difficulties with
the regular coke supplier. For instance, on 20 May 2016, Mr Oravec, responsible for the

Procurement of Strategic Raw Materials at the Company, wrote:

“[...] purchase of Coke from Slovakia is an emergency purchase because supplier
from Lukavac has logistical issues caused by Croatian railways repairing a tunnel,
which prevents transportation of coal from Ploce to Lukavac. We are going next week
to inspect situation in Lukavac and to find solution. We need to buy this Coke from
Slovakia in order not to jeopardize the production in the meantime.”>

355. The evidence also shows that the First Claimant took steps to remedy the negative
impact of these externals events, to the extent possible. For instance, on 30 May 2016 Mr
Kamaras met with another coke supplier,3* and on 5 June 2016 coke was ordered, via Pikaro,

from alternative sources.>°

356. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the raw material supply issues do not

amount to a breach of the MSA, and at least not one that would justify an immediate

termination pursuant to Article 127 LO, The Respondents have not shown that the
Claimants’ conduct was such that they would not perform the MSA during a subsequent

Correction Period and that thus any such Correction Period was unnecessary or useless.

(6) Other Issues

357, Finally, the Respondents argue that the Claimants obstructed the Privatisation and
closing of the Privatisation Agreement by failing to prepare and provide necessary
information to HeSteel, or to otherwise assist the Privatisation.°% Among other things, the
Respondents allege that the Claimants failed to hire the required legal assistance, and to

convene regular coordination meetings.” The Claimants deny these allegations.’

358. The Tribunal finds that the Respondents have not established these points. To the
contrary, the documentary evidence shows that the Claimants did set up co-ordination
meetings.” Moreover, there is no contemporaneous document complaining about any lack

of legal or other information.

359, In sum, the Tribunal finds that the Respondents have not established any breaches of
the MSA that would justify the immediate termination thereof. Having looked at the
Claimants’ conduct regarding the various alleged breaches, the Tribunal finds that such
conduct does not warrant an immediate termination under Article 127 LO, forgoing the
Correction Period provided for in Article 126 LO and Clause 8.1.1 of the MSA.

360. Asaconsequence, the Tribunal finds that the Second Termination Notice of 25 June
2016 was not validly made. The Tribunal therefore does not need to look at the other alleged
bases of invalidity of the Second Termination Notice, e.g. the argument that it was contrary to

Serbian corporate law,*!° good faith*" ete.

4, Amount of Privatisation Bonus

361. Having thus established that the Second Termination of 25 June 2016 was not valid,
the Privatisation Bonus is due under Clause 3,2.9 of the MSA. This is undisputed between

the Parties, as noted above”

362. The Parties are, however, in dispute about the amount of the Privatisation Bonus

under Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA. Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA provides as follows:

“Tn addition to the Management Fee outlined in clauses 3.2.4, 3.2.5, 3.2.6, 3.2.7 and
3.2.8, the Service Provider shall be entitled to a bonus fee in case of any privatisation
of the Company that occurs within 5 (five) years (or a period of five years plus any
additional period of this Agreement agreed to under clause 7.2 hereof) calculated as of
the Closing of this Agreement, in the amount equal to 30% of the acquisition price
of the Company’ stake achieved through such privatisation procedure but in no
event lower than USD 10,000,000 (ten million dollars) (the Privatisation Bonus).”?"
363. Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA thus provides for a guaranteed minimum Privatisation Bonus
of 10 million (the “Minimum Bonus”), but also for the possibility of a higher bonus
calculated as “30% of the acquisition price of the Company’ stake achieved through such

privatisation procedure” (the “Variable Bonus”),

364. According to the Claimant, the Variable Bonus applies to all kinds of privatisation
procedures and thus should be 30% of the price paid by HeSteel for the Company’s assets,
whereas the Respondents argue that the Variable Bonus does not apply to a privatisation

through an asset sale.3'5

365. More specifically, the Claimants state that (i) the term “stake” in Clause 3.2.9 of the
MSA has a broad meaning going beyond “shares;”*"° (ii) the Parties could have used a more
specific wording in Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA (such as “equity” or “shares’’) but did not;3"7

(iii) the English version of the MSA prevails;?!* (iv) any other interpretation does not

correspond to the will of the Parties or the purpose of the Privatisation Bonus;*”” and (v) the

MSA Negotiation Transcript does not show anything else.?”°

366. To the contrary, according to the Respondents (i) the term “stake” in Clause 3.2.9 of
the MSA is most commonly used in the commercial context as “equity of a company, i.e. its
shares;”*?! (ii) the Serbian version of Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA uses the term “wdela” (from
“udeo”) which means “shares” in Serbian;*” (iii) the transcript of the MSA negotiations
confirms this understanding referring to “equity”;>* and (iv) there is no purpose of a success
bonus in case of an asset sale since the value of the assets “has nothing to do with the
Claimants and their effort (or at the very best, their influence could have only been

marginal).

367. In interpreting Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA, the Tribunal will look in turn at (i) the literal
meaning of Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA, (ii) the context of the negotiations of the MSA; (iii) the
purpose of the privatisation bonus in Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA; and (iv) the Parties’

subsequent conduct.

a) Literal Meaning of Clause 3.2.9 MSA

368. Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA refers to “30% of the acquisition price of the Company’s

stake achieved through such privatisation procedure.”2?5

369. While the Claimants are correct that the word “stake” might in certain instances have
a broader meaning, in the context of commercial transactions and companies, the term
“stake” refers to “participation” (such as in the forms of shares). This is indeed also how the

Claimants themselves have repeatedly used the term in their submissions:

“Subsequently in September 2015 the businessmen behind GLS (Yves Nassan and
Lazar Fruchter) did acquire a minority stake in the Bidder but even that would not
have satisfied the control requirements in the MSA.”6

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 89 of 116

“the evidence that Lazar and Fruchter’s stake was only 20% [...]”?7

370. This interpretation is also confirmed by the Serbian version, and the use of the term
“udela’ (from “udeo’). It is clear that in case of any discrepancies between the English and
Serbian version, the English version prevails pursuant to Clause 15.3.1 of MSA which

provides that:

“This Agreement has been executed in Serbian and English language. In case of any
discrepancy or inconsistency between these two versions, the English version shall
prevail.”
371. However, the Tribunal finds that here there is no discrepancy or inconsistency
between the English and Serbian versions on this point since both language versions point in
the same direction, i.e. that “stake” or “udeo” should be interpreted as meaning

“participation” or “shares.”

372. A difficulty in the literal interpretation of Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA arises from the
fact that it refers to “the Company’s stake” which, in correct English, would mean the stake
of the Company and thus the participation (or shares) the Company holds in another
company. It is undisputed that the Company’s participation (or shares) in another company
was not (and could not have been) part of the Privatisation. Rather, what was a possible
means of privatisation was to sell the participation (or shares) in the Company. The Tribunal
is satisfied that this somewhat incorrect use of the English is due to the fact that mostly non-
native English lawyers negotiated and drafted the text of the MSA in English (which was
later translated into Serbian). This is the result indeed from the documentary evidence” and

was confirmed by the Respondents’ counsel at the Hearing:

“MR JACOBS: Okay. There were obviously some drafts before the final MSA.
Were those drafts always circulated in English, just like the red line we have seen?

[Mr Pavic]: Only English. Only the -- not only the final -- I think we have -- I don't
know when the translation was done from English to Serbian, whether it was
already done around 20 March or not. The translation -- I think by the time we
selected it, if 1 am not mistaken and we selected them around 20 March, that at that
time only the English version was around, and Serbian version was included in -- as a
translation few days after.”**°

b) Negotiations of Clause 3.2.9 MSA

373. The Parties also refer to a transcript of the negotiations of the MSA held in mid-
March 2015.3!

374. The Claimants refer to a passage of the transcript at p. 23 which reads as follows:

“ML [Marek Lorinz, on behalf of the Claimants]: The consideration was, let’s say if
you, let’s say want to privatize the plant before the expiration of 3 years, th{e]n we are
entitled to the success fee, which is X % of the sale price, X % of investment
commitment but no less than asked for.

MH [Mark Harrison, on behalf of the Claimants]: That sounds like you’re happy. I
mean... for those 3 years MSA agreement, and as you say, whoever comes along in a
really good phase, it’s a win-win, the Government wins, we take the success fee and
that’s it.”

375, According to the Claimants this shows that what was proposed at this stage was a

percentage of the “sale price” irrespective of the form of privatisation?

376. The Tribunal is unconvinced about this argument. To the contrary, in the Tribunal’s
view, the reference to an “investment commitment” shows that what the Parties had in mind
was that the purchaser invested in the Company after the privatisation. This is different from
an asset sale where the Company, after having sold its assets, is an empty shell in which no

one would consider investing.

377. The Respondents rely on another passage of the transcript on pp. 33-34 in which Mr
Boris Milosevic rejected the idea of a 30% bonus on the investment or capital commitment to

the Company, but accepted a 30% bonus on the equity. He stated:

“BM: With respect to the exit bonus, our suggestion is to have it 30% of the sales
price only, without these capital commitments, because this would be very difficult to
assess and to calcul Capital it will be hing that the company will
get and I think it’s very difficult for the company to find the cash given that those
capital commitments will be over a 5 period... 5 years to find cash now in order to
pay 30% of the future capital commitment by somebody.”

 

“BM: No, that’s... sure, that’s understandable. I mean you know in privatizations that
they weight those things differently. One is the purchase price weighting, one is the

weighting of a... No, no, I’m talking about we cannot have 30% on the equity and
30% on the capital commitment.”

“BM: If it’s a 30% of the privatization proceeds for the equity and or higher of 30%
of that or 10 million dollars, I think that is ok.”

According to the Respondents this shows that what the Parties had in mind was that

the Variable Bonus of 30% applied to an equity sale, i.e. if the Republic of Serbia sold its

participation in the Company.

379.

The Tribunal is satisfied that this is indeed what the Parties had in mind during the

negotiation of the MSA, and this was accepted by Mr Kamaras as he confirmed at the

Hearing:

“PROFESSOR ORLIC: Good. Can we go to the page 34 [of the Negotiation
Transcript]? It goes like this:

"Peter Kamaras: No, no, Iam listening. Do you have any suggestions?
"Boris Milosevic: Our suggestion was only
Mark Harrison zero", and there was general laughter. Now,

Mr Boris Milosevic says, and I am quoting: "If it is a 30 per cent of the privatization
receipts for the equity and/or higher of 30 per cent of that or $10 million I think that is
okay"

"Peter Kamaras: Okay"
So you accepted what Boris Milosevic ask you for.

A Yes, Professor, yes. I did. Can I put the broader picture behind it? There was a
discussion brought by Marek Lor[i]nz, what happens if Zelezara is giving away for
nothing for investment in case somebody comes and says okay, I will get it for free,
but I invest 1 billion, that is basically what the Chinese did. For this case they
suggested this minimum 10 million amount. This was my understanding of this 10
million, and somebody get it for free but promises -- we originally, I think, I believe it
should be there, ask also for 30 per cent. Marek Lorinz gave me this idea, asking for
30 per cent of the investment, can be outrageous number so this was rejected flatly, so
we agreed that in case of such a strange -- well, not strange actually, but -- there is this
minimum of 10 million, okay? And in case it is sold for real money, that there is
money to be paid to the government, then we get 30 per cent. This was my
understanding of the story.

PROFESSOR ORLIC: But it was said for the equity.

A It says so very likely, yes. It says so in the transcript, yes.”>°”

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 92 of 116

380. Mr Kamaras thus confirmed that for a situation like at present (“that is basically what
the Chinese did”) the Minimum Bonus of 10 million was agreed (“For this case they
suggested this minimum 10 million amount. This was my understanding of this 10 million
[...]”). In case the Republic of Serbia sold its participation in the Company, the Variable
Bonus of 30% was meant to apply (if “there is money to be paid to the government, then we

get 30 per cent”).

381. Finally, in the context of the MSA negotiations, the Claimants also refer to an email
sent on 15 March 2015, attaching a revised draft MSA.*** It was in this round of edits that the
language “of the Company’s stake” was included.*” The Claimants refer to the cover email
sent with the draft MSA which states, among other things, “[i]n the enclosed version of the
MSA we defined in much better way the termination clauses in order to outline exactly what
agreed on the meeting (other changes made to the MSA are more or less of a technical
nature).”*° The Claimants deduce from this that the change regarding the Privatisation
Bonus in Clause 3.2.9 of the draft MSA was not meant to bring any chance and thus

continued to apply irrespective of the addition of “the Company’s stake.”3"

382. The Tribunal does not find this argument convincing. The cover email clearly states:
“Enclosed please find the Management Services Agreement (the MSA) revised by KPMG.
We are of the opinion that this draft version of the MSA reflects all what agreed on the
yesterday’s meeting.” Had the draft including the edit regarding “the Company’s stake”
not reflected the Parties’ agreement, the Claimants should have pointed this out, and no such
evidence is on file. In any event, the relevant change in the wording did reflect the discussion

at the meeting.

c) Purpose of Clause 3.2.9 MSA

383. Finally, the Parties argue about the purpose of the Variable Bonus in Clause 3.2.9 of
the MSA.

384. The Respondents argue that the purpose of the Variable Bonus of 30% was to

incentivize the First Claimant to manage the Company in such a way as to make it the most

profitable.** Therefore, according to the Respondents, the Variable Bonus does not apply to
an asset sale since the value of the assets “has nothing to do with the Claimants and their

effort (or at the very best, their influence could have only been marginal).”**

385. The Claimants challenge this argument and state that “the value of physical assets will
depend on the success of management — in a steel mill, management has a lot to do with the
good condition of the furnaces, the level of stock, etc.” They add that “such improvements

will also affect the profitability of those assets and of any acquired entity [...].”°

386. The Tribunal finds with the Respondents on this point. The Parties systematically
referred to the Privatisation Bonus as a “success fee” in their negotiations, including for

instance here:

“ML [Marek Lorinz, on behalf of the Claimants]: The consideration was, let’s say if
you, let’s say want to privatize the plant before the expiration of 3 years, th[e]n we are
entitled to the success fee, which is X % of the sale price, X % of investment
commitment but no less than asked for.

MH [Mark Harrison, on behalf of the Claimants: That sounds like you’re happy. I
mean... for those 3 years MSA agreement, and as you say, whoever comes along in a
really good phase, it’s a win-win, the Government wins, we take the success fee and
that’s it.”34
387. This shows the understanding that the Variable Bonus was to incentivize and reward
“success” on the First Claimant’s part, as manager of the Company, to make it profitable.
While the value of the assets of the Company (e.g. title to land, infrastructure etc.) might be
maintained or possibly even be slightly increased, it remains largely independent of the

management of the Company.

388. The analysis might be slightly different for raw materials: the manager can increase
the stocks and thus the value of the assets. It is, however, wrong to suggest that this be a sign
of successful management. As explained by the Claimants’ witness, Mr Stanislav Barica, the
raw material levels are those needed for the steel production, not more not less; any
unwarranted increase in raw material stocks (and thus value) risks to lead to their

deterioration, even though they had to be paid for by the Company:

“Fresh coke relatively quickly deteriorates in quality and begins to disintegrate,
reducing its efficiency. The coke’s function in the blast furnace is to create a
supporting structure and allow wind flow through the charge, so the size and strength
of the coke are very important. If a company keeps a higher inventory of coke on site,
it will suffer from a significantly higher volume of undersize coke (due to
disintegration), which cannot be charged directly into the blast furnace. The only use
for undersize, degraded coke is as a replacement fuel for sinter production, but as
coke is very expensive compared with the fuel ordinarily used for sinter production,
this is uneconomical and increases production costs. Accordingly, the ordering and
storage of coke on site requires a careful balancing act.”*"

389. The Tribunal is thus satisfied that the purpose of the Variable Bonus was to
incentivize successful management on the part of the First Claimant, and that this purpose
shows that the Variable Bonus does not apply to an asset sale for which the price depends on

the value of the assets and not the manager’s success.

d) Parties’ Subsequent Conduct

390. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants also refer to a number of documents
showing the Parties’ subsequent conduct, such as (i) exchange of emails between Mr
Kamaras and Mr Milosevic on 21 April 2016; and (ii) a draft Annex to the MSA, also
exchanged between the Parties in April 2016.3”

391. However, the Tribunal is of the opinion that these subsequent documents, established
at a time when the Parties were already gearing up for a dispute, are less relevant. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal holds that nothing in the above-mentioned documents are of
such a nature as to change the conclusion on the amount of the Privatisation due under Clause

3.2.9 of the MSA.

392. In sum, and in light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Variable Bonus as per
Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA does not apply to the Privatisation in the case at hand which was
done in the form of an asset sale. Accordingly, the amount of the Privatisation Bonus due
under Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA is USD 10 million.

5. Debtor of the Privatisation Bonus

393. Having determined that the Privatisation Bonus of USD 10 million is due to the

Claimants, the Tribunal now turns to the question who must pay such amount. The Parties

disagree on this point. The Claimants argue that the First and Second Respondents are both

liable: either as a matter of their joint and several liability under the MSA*® or because the |
First Respondent is independently liable to the Claimants,**! while the Respondents deny any

liability on the part of the First Respondent.> The Tribunal will look at the two series of

arguments in turn.

a) Joint and Several Liability of the First and Second Respondent

394. According to the Claimants, the First and Second Respondents are jointly and
severally liable.*> The Claimants argue that joint and several liability results, among other
things, from (i) Serbian law; (ii) the wording of Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA which states
without limitations that the Service Provider “shall be entitled to” a Privatisation Bonus;3*
and (iii) the Parties’ intention and common sense since “the obligation to compensate the
Service Provider [...] naturally falls on RoS as well as the Company.”*> The Respondents

deny any liability of the First Respondent.3%

395. First, on the Serbian law point, the Claimants argue that the MSA is a “contract of
order” under Article 749 LO, and that therefore pursuant to Article 764 LO the First and

Second Respondents are jointly and severally liable.
396. Article 749 LO provides:

“(1) By contract of order the provider undertakes the obligation towards the principal
to perform certain actions on his account.

(2) At the same time the provider shall be authorized to undertake such actions.

(3) The provider shall be entitled to remuneration for his effort, unless otherwise
provided by the contract or derives from the nature of the mutual relationship between
the parties.”5°”

397. Article 764 LO reads as follows:

“Should several principals entrust a performance of an order to a provider, they shall

be jointly and severally liable towards him.”*8
398. Inthe Tribunal’s view, the MSA is not a “contract of order” in the sense of Article
749 LO. Under the MSA, the Service Provider was to provide certain management services
to the Company. Clause 3.2.1 of the MSA relates to the “Provision of Management Services”
and states that “[t]he Service Provider shall provide the Company with the Management
Services during the Term.”* According to Clause 1.1 of the MSA, “Management Services”
means “the management services to be provided by the Service Provider pursuant to clause
3,3 which in turn lists a number of services regarding the management of the Company.
These are services provided by the Service Provider to the Company and not an “obligation
towards the principal to perform certain actions on his account” such as envisaged by Article
749 LO. Furthermore, this argument does not assist the Claimants in establishing the liability
of the First Respondent, since the services were to be provided to the Company, not to the

First Respondent.

399. In any event, even assuming the MSA was to be qualified as a “contract of order” as
per Article 749 LO, joint and several liability according to Article 764 LO only applies absent
any other agreement by the Parties, as per Article 10 LO which provides that “[t]he parties in
an obligation relationship are free to regulate their relations upon their own will, within the
limits of imperative norms, public policy and good customs, as they find appropriate.”°"" The
possibility of agreement to the contrary is accepted by the Claimants.*? As detailed below,

the Parties agreed that the First Respondent was not liable to pay the Privatisation Bonus.

400. Second, looking at the provisions of the MSA, the Claimants argue that Clause 3.2.9
of the MSA provides that the Service Provider “shall be entitled to a bonus fee” without any

limitation, and because Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA does not say “it is only due from one of the

RoS and the Company” it results that both of them are jointly and severally liable2°

401. The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant’s interpretation. Clause 3.2.9 of the
MSA is silent as to the debtor of the Privatisation Bonus. Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA merely
provides that:

“Tn addition to the Management Fee outlined in clauses 3.2.4, 3.2.5, 3.2.6, 3.2.7 and
3.2.8, the Service Provider shall be entitled to a bonus fee in case of any privatisation
of the Company [...] (the Privatisation Bonus).
402. However, other provisions of the MSA deal with the invoicing and payment of the
Privatisation Bonus and clearly refer to the Company as the debtor of the payment obligation.
Among others, Clause 5.1.1 relates to the Management Fees (which includes the Privatisation
Bonus under Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA) and provides that any invoice shall be made to the
Company:
“The Management Fees as regulated by 3.2.4, 3.2.5, 3.2 .6, 3.2.7, 3.2.8 and 3.2.9 shall
be reimbursed as stipulated in clause 3.2 and invoiced to the Company.»
403. Similarly, Clause 5.1.2 of the MSA deals with any such payment to the Service
Provider and provides that it shall be made by the Company:

“All payments required by this Agreement to be made to the Service Provider shall
be made by the Company by means of bank transfer in RSD, in accordance with the
median exchange rate of the National Bank of Serbia on the day of payment to the
Service Provider’s account RSD 170- 30023743000-98, as set out in the invoice.”
404. Clause 5.1.9 relates to the right to object to invoices issued pursuant to Clause 5.1.1

and, again, only refers to the Company:
“Such invoice would be payable immediately and the Company would not have the
tight to object to it.”

405. Moreover, Clause 8.5 of the MSA, which deals with the effects of termination on the
Privatisation Bonus, refers to the payment of the Privatisation Bonus by the Company,

without mentioning the Republic of Serbia in this context:

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 98 of 116

“Tf the RoS or the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with clause 8.4,
the Company shall be obliged to pay to the Service Provider the Privatization Bonus
in line with the terms specified in clause 3.2.9.”

406. The result of the above-mentioned provisions of the MSA is that the Company is the

debtor of the Privatisation Bonus, and not the First Respondent.

407. Third, the contemporaneous evidence from the time when the Parties negotiated the
MSA also shows the Parties’ agreement to exclude any liability of the First Respondent. The
question of the liability of the Republic of Serbia was discussed at length during the
negotiation meeting held on 14 March 2015. The issue was that any liability by the
Republic of Serbia could have been interpreted as illegal state-aid under European Union
law” While the Parties did not seem to have found a solution during the negotiations on 14
March 2015, a later email exchange resolved this point. In an email, dated 15 March 2015,
Mr Mladjan Marjanovic sent a revised version of the MSA, with revisions made by KPMG

on behalf of the Respondents, and noted in his cover email:

“As we have already informed you, any kind of guarantee of the Republic of Serbia
would be considered as a State Aid. Hence, we deleted any monetary obligation of
the Republic of Serbia from the Agreement (re payment obligations in case Zelezara
fails to pay its liabilities)."°
408. Indeed, one of the changes suggested in the red-line version of the MSA was to
include in Clause 5.1.3, discussed above, that any payment was to be made by the
Company:

$445.13 Invoices referring to the Fixed Fee shall be issued monthly and shall be payable
by the Company in accordance with terms of this Agreement.

409. In the reply email, dated 16 March 2015, the Claimants confirmed their agreement on
this point. Mr Goran Martinovic on behalf of the Claimants replied to several points made by
the Respondents in a table format. Regarding the issue of the liability of the Republic of
Serbia, the column “HPK Reply” reads as follows:

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 99 of 116

“We have accepted this and have removed the language that was stating that the
RoS would be liable for the Company obligation in respect of the obligations arising
out of the MSA.”
410. In light of the above, there can be no doubt as to the Parties’ agreement that the First
Respondent would not be liable for any obligations arising out of the MSA, including the

payment of the Privatisation Bonus.

411. Fourth and finally, this is also confirmed by the Claimants’ contemporaneous
understanding. Indeed, on 18 April 2016, the First Claimant issued a pro forma invoice
regarding the Privatisation Bonus. This invoice is only addressed to, and payment only
requested from, the Company (i.e. the Second Respondent) and not the Republic of Serbia
(i.e, the First Respondent).3”

412. Insum, and in light of the above, the Tribunal finds that there is no joint and several
liability for the First and Second Respondent, and that only the Second Respondent is be
liable for the payment of the Privatisation Bonus under the MSA.

b) Independent Liability of the First Respondent

413. The Claimants further argue that the First Respondent is independently liable on the
basis that it (i) breached the MSA; (ii) procured the Second Respondent to breach the MSA.
and thus committed a tort under Serbian law; and (iii) abused the rule of limited liability.”

The Respondents deny these points.”

414. First, regarding the First Respondent’s alleged breach of the MSA: in essence, the
Claimants argue that the First Respondent breached the MSA with the Second Termination
notice. More specifically, they allege that “the termination it forced through was in breach of
the MSA because (a) Zelezara was not entitled to terminate under its terms, (b) the circular
Decision violated MSA protective terms such as co-signature, HPK’s position as CEO and
the role of the SB (3.4.1 to 3.4.3, 3.3); and (c) was in bad faith.”

415. As detailed above, the Tribunal has found that the Second Termination Notice by the
Second Respondent was invalid.*” As such, the Second Termination Notice was without
legal effect. Accordingly, the Claimants have failed to show how the Second Termination
Notice amounted to a separate breach of the MSA, by the First Respondent or otherwise, that
has any detrimental consequences on the Claimants. The detrimental consequences to the
Claimants merely flow from the failure to pay the Privatisation Bonus, which (as discussed

above) was a liability of the Company.

416. Second, the Claimants further argue that the First Respondent is liable under Serbian
tort law because it procured the Second Respondent to breach the MSA.3% The Claimants
have provided no support for their theory that inducing a contractual breach leads to tortious
liability under Serbian law. Moreover, and in any event, under the Claimants’ theory, the
alleged breach by the Second Respondent, procured by the First Respondent, is “the sending
of the invalid Second Termination Notice.”*” For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal has
found that the Second Termination Notice was invalid and without legal effect, and therefore
the Claimants have failed to show how it could be an induced breach of the MSA causing any

harm to the Claimants.

417. Third, the Claimants further state that the First Respondent abused the rules of limited
liability under Serbian corporate law because the First Respondent’s actions caused the
Second Respondent not to pay the Privatisation Bonus, which the Company would have
otherwise paid.*” According to the Claimants, the First Respondent “used Zelezara’s
corporate identity, in a bad faith termination plan to rid itself of HPK and liability for the
bonus [...]. It used Zelezara instead of giving notice itself in an abusive attempt to avoid
liability (had it given notice itself, its breach would have been even more direct).”°” The fact
that the Second Respondent, instead of the First Respondent, has issued the Second
Termination Notice is irrelevant, since, as detailed above, the Second Termination Notice is
invalid and without legal effect. Therefore the liability of the Second Respondent has not

been discharged or affected by the Second Termination Notice.

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 101 of 116

418. Furthermore, the Tribunal does not accept that there was any abuse of limited liability
by the First Respondent. As set out above, the only liability for the Privatisation Bonus was a
liability of the Second Respondent. The First Respondent did not in any sense use the
Second Respondent to cause damage to the Claimants. Whilst it is true that there has (on the
Tribunal’s findings) been a failure to pay the Privatisation Bonus, and that this should now be
paid by the Second Respondent, there is no connection between the Second Respondent’s

failure to pay and any “abuse of limited liability.”

419. Insum, the Claimant’s arguments regarding the First Respondent’s independent

liability are inapposite.

6. Creditor of the Privatisation Bonus

420. Having found that the Second Respondent is liable to pay the Privatisation Bonus, as

determined in the previous sections, the Tribunal now turns to the question to whom it is due.

421. The Claimants’ request for relief has varied on this point. In their Statement of Case,

the Claimants sought the payment to be made to the Service Provider, i.e. the First Claimant:

“Declaring that RoS and the Company are jointly liable to pay to the Service Provider
[...] the Privatisation Bonus pursuant to clause 3.2.9 of the MSA.

Ordering the Company and RoS jointly and severally to pay to the Service Provider
an amount equal to 30% of the Acquisition Price plus VAT of 20% of that sum, plus
interest accruing from 30 June 2016 (to be assessed) plus costs.”
422. However, in subsequent submissions, the Claimants sought payment to be made to
both Claimants:

“Tn conclusion, it is submitted that the Tribunal should award the Claimants
€16,197,806.09 plus VAT at 20%, and RSD 100,536,504 by way of management fee
for May and June 2016, in damages or debt. If the correct privatisation bonus turns
out to be higher, the Claimants will claim the higher sum.”*!

423. The Claimants provide no explanation as to the legal basis for the Second Claimant’s

claims other than:

“HPK Engineering B.V. is the Bidder for the purposes of the MSA and the sole owner
of the Service Provider. It has an interest in enforcing the terms of the MSA because
of the benefit it may derive as sole owner of the Service Provider from the recovery of

money owed to the Service Provider. It therefore has valid claims against the
Company and RoS for declarations as to the liability of the Company and RoS and is
therefore a proper party to this arbitration.”

424. The Respondents deny that any amounts are due to the Second Claimant.>*

425. The Tribunal finds with the Respondents on this point. Regarding the Privatisation
Bonus, Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA clearly states that it is due to the Service Provider:

“In addition to the Management Fee outlined in clauses 3.2.4, 3.2.5, 3.2.6, 3.2.7 and

3.2.8, the Service Provider shall be entitled to a bonus fee in case of any privatisation

of the Company that occurs within 5 (five) years [...] (the Privatisation Bonus).”>*
426. Moreover, it was the First Claimant (i.e. the Service Provider) who issued the pro
forma invoice regarding the Privatisation Bonus on 18 April 2016. The Second Claimant is

not mentioned.

427. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Privatisation Bonus is due to the First

Claimant only.

428. Insum, the Tribunal finds that the Second Respondent owes USD 10,000,000 to the

First Claimant as the Privatisation Bonus pursuant to Clause 3.2.9 of the MSA.

D. MANAGEMENT FEES

429. According to the Claimants, the Service Provider has a right to the Management Fee
for the months of May and June 2016 until the termination of the MSA took effect,** and has
issued invoices accordingly.**” According to the Respondents no such Management Fee is

due.3*

“The Service Provider shall be entitled to a Management Fee for its Management
Services. The Management Fee shall consist of the fixed fee and variable fee as more
closely defined below.”

431. Clause 3.2.5 of the MSA further provides:

“The fixed portion of the Management Fee shall amount EUR 340,000 (three hundred

and forty thousand euros) per month (VAT exclusive) (the Fixed Fee).
432. The Tribunal finds that the Respondents have failed to provide any valid reasons why
the Fixed Fee pursuant to Clause 3.2.5 of the MSA should not be due for the months of May
and June 2016. The Respondents have not established, indeed not even argued, that the
Claimants have failed to manage the Company during those months. The idea of the Fixed
Fee (as opposed to the Variable Fee in Clause 3.2.6 and the Privatisation Bonus in Clause
3.2.9 of the MSA) is that it is due as long as the Service Provider is the manager of the

Company.

433. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the monthly Fixed Management Fee is
due for the months of May and June until the end of the MSA on 30 June 2016, as per the

First Termination Notice, as determined above.>”!

434. The Management Fee is due by the Second Respondent to the First Claimant. First,
this results from Clause 3.2.4 of the MSA which provides that “[t]he Service Provider shall
be entitled to a Management Fee." Second, the arguments above regarding joint and
several liability apply equally here. Third, this is indeed what results from the invoices
issued by the First Claimant to the Second Respondent on 31 May 2016 (for the Management
Fee for May 2016) and 30 June 2016 (for the Management Fee for June 2016).

435. Finally, the amount sought in the Claimants’ request for relief is for Serbian Dinar
(RSD) 100,536,504 which corresponds to the sum of the two invoices: RSD 50,225,412 for
May 2016°* and RSD 50,311,092 for June 2016.5”

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 104 of 116

436. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Second Respondent owes to the First
Claimant RSD 50,225,412 for the Management Fee for May 2016 and RSD 50,311,092 for
June 2016.

E. INTEREST

437. On the point of interest, the Claimants have referred to Article 26.4 of the LCIA Rules
and Section 5.2.1 of the MSA and made the following submission:

“As stated on the website of the National Bank of Serbia, the default interest rate is
the key policy rate plus 8% and the key policy rate was 4% from 07.07.16, then
3.75% from 07.09.17, then 3.5% from 09.10.17 to date. HPK claim simple interest on
all their claims at the above rates for the period 30.06.16 (30.05.16 for the May
management fee), to date of payment. At 01.01.18 this will total €3,026,562 accruing
at €5,317 daily thereafter. We submit such rate is the agreed rate and is appropriate.
We do not know if this approach will be disputed but, if for any reason it is not
accepted by the Tribunal, we submit that at the least a high commercial rate (c. 9% to
reflect Serbian borrowing costs) would be appropriate and interest should then be
awarded on a compound basis with quarterly rests.”>°
438. According to the Respondents, the relevant provisions are those of Serbian law
concerning default interest, and in particular the Law on Default Interest No. 119/2012 (the
“Law on Default Interest”). The Respondents state that “for debt in domestic currency
(Serbian dinars) the rate of interest per annum is 8% plus key policy rate [and] [flor euro-
denominated debt, Article 4(1) of the Law [on Default Interest] states explicitly that the
annual default interest rate is 8% plus main refinancing operation rate of the European
Central Bank.”*” The Respondents add that “[s]ince the main refinancing operations rate of

the ECB is zero, default interest rate on euro-denominated debt is 8%.’°!

439. The Respondents further allege that “Claimants seek compound interest” which,
according to the Respondents, “is prohibited in Serbian law, and declared unconstitutional by

the Serbian Constitutional Court [...] [and] thus an element of Serbian public policy.”
440. The relevant provisions are as follows. Article 26.4 of the LCIA Rules provides:

“Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the Arbitral Tribunal may order that
simple or compound interest shall be paid by any party on any sum awarded at such

3°8 CPHB, at para. 123.

rates as the Arbitral Tribunal decides to be appropriate (without being bound by rates
of interest practised by any state court or other legal authority) in respect of any
period which the Arbitral Tribunal decides to be appropriate ending not later than the
date upon which the award is complied with.”

441. Inthe MSA, the Parties agreed on interest rates as follows in Section 5.2.1:

“Tn the event the Company does not pay any amount due within the applicable time
frame, the Service Provider may charge interest at the rate of the official legal default
interest rate in line with the Governing Law.“

442. Pursuant, to Sections 1.1 and 17.3 of the MSA the “Governing Law” is Serbian law,
so the Law on Default Interest applies. According to its Article 1, the Law on Default
Interest, “prescribes the rate and the manner of calculating the default interest to be paid by
the debtor which is in default with performance of a monetary obligation.”4° Article 2
specifies that “[t]he debtor which is in default with performance of a monetary obligation,
owes, alongside the principal, the default interest in correspondence with the amount of the

debt, until the date of payment, at the rate determined by this law.4°*

443. Articles 3 and 4 determine the rate of default interest as being eight percent points

above a reference rate. The reference rate differs according to the currency of the main debt:

a. if the debt is in Serbian dinar, Article 3 provides that “[t]he rate of the default
interest [...] is determined yearly, at the level of key policy rate of the National Bank

of Serbia, increased by eight percentage points;”

b. if the debt is in Euros, Article 4(1) provides that “[t]he rate of the default
interest [...] is determined yearly, at the level of reference interest rate of the
European Central Bank for main refinancing operations, increased by eight

percentage points;” and

c if the debit is another foreign currently, Article 4(2) provides that “[t}he rate of
the default interest [...] is determined yearly, at the level of reference/basic interest

rate which is prescribed and/or applied at performing main operations by the

43 LCIA Rules, Article 26.4 (emphasis added).

central bank of the state of domicile currency, increased by eight percentage

points,”4°7

444. In application of the above, for the Management Fees which are due in Serbian dinar,
the applicable interest rate is eight percent points above the key policy rate of the National
Bank of Serbia. The key policy rate of the National Bank of Serbia is set out on its website
http://nbs.rs/internet/english/33/33_8/index.html and the historical data for Serbian dinar is:

446. The Management Fee for June became due on 30 June 2016, and the applicable
interest rate is thus:

a. from 1 July 2016 to 7 July 2016: 12.25%;

b. from 8 July 2016 to 7 September 2017: 12%;

in application of Article 4(2) of the Law on Default Interest, 8 percent points above “the
reference/basic interest rate which is prescribed and/or applied at performing main operations
by the central bank of the state of domicile currency”, i.e. the US Federal Reserve Bank

(FED). These are also set out on the website of the National Bank of Serbia:

449. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that the interest above is simple and
not compound interest, and runs only until the main debt is paid in full.
KF. OTHER RELIEF REQUESTED BY THE CLAIMANTS

450. In addition to the requests for relief dealt with by the Tribunal above, the Claimants
have, at times, included additional relief in their submissions. For instance, in their Witness

Submission, the Claimants requested declaratory relief as follows:

“Further or alternatively the Claimants claim declarations as appropriate as per
paragraphs 160, 165, 167 and/or 168 above.”*°

451. The same relief was included in the Claimants’ Rebuttal Witness Submission and

Post-Hearing Brief.*"°

452. Having granted the Claimants’ primary relief for payment, in the previous sections,
the Claimants’ alternative declaratory relief is moot. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal
dismisses the requests for the same reasons as those stated in the previous sections.

G. ARBITRATION COSTS

453. The Claimants, in their Cost Submission, list their costs as follows:4"'

 

 

 

  

 

a HKLLP Pr ional Charge: £718,695
b Disbursements (e.g. travel, translation, transcription, printing, copying)... £32,946
c_ Barrister’s fee: £236,282
d_ Experts’ fee: £230,965
e Serbian law advice. £171,751
f LClA advance payments to date. £111,750

Total. £1,502,389

 

454. The Claimants further make the following submissions:

“Tn arbitrations like this, costs should presumptively follow the event (see LCIA Rule
28.4). If the Claimants are successful — that is, if they are awarded the privatisation
bonus — they should be awarded their costs. If, hypothetically, the Claimants lose on
more collateral issues (e.g. whether HPK Engineering has its own claim), they should
still recover costs in full. The bulk of costs were incurred on the core issues of
whether there was breach justifying termination and whether termination was
lawful/in good faith. Both Respondents should be ordered to pay the Claimants’ costs

jointly and severally, even if, hypothetically, liability is found only against the
Company. The Respondents forced the Claimants to bring proceedings by refusing to
pay which was RoS’s decision as was the decision to terminate. Moreover, RoS, as
the sole owner of the Company, is funding and directing the conduct of the
proceedings. The Respondents could potentially have avoided these proceedings but
refused the Claimants’ Request for Mediation made at the outset under the LCIA
Mediation Rules. The Respondents should be ordered jointly and severally to pay the
Claimants’ costs in full.

The above costs are reasonable and proportionate to the complexity of the issues
raised in this arbitration and the amounts in dispute. Under Rule 28.4 the Tribunal
may take into account the parties’ conduct, including cooperation in facilitating the
proceedings in time and cost and any non-co-operation resulting in undue delay and
expense. There is nothing in the Claimants’ conduct that warrants any deduction. The
Claimants engaged constructively with the arbitral process at all times and co-
operated fully with all directions of the Tribunal. They enabled the proceedings to be
conducted quickly and efficiently according to the timetable. The Respondents’
argument in recent correspondence that the Claimants engaged in ‘guerrilla’ tactics is
nonsense. For example, the Respondents’ complained that the Claimants ‘rejuggled’
expert testimony ‘on the fly’. In fact, the expert evidence was updated to help the
Tribunal grapple with new points arising for the first time in cross-examination. The
Claimants did not win every procedural debate but they won many. None of their
stances was unreasonable. All procedural disputes were swiftly resolved.

By contrast, it was the Respondents’ conduct that increased the costs of this
arbitration. The Respondents took a scorched earth approach. Instead of focussing on
the real issues, they made a wide range of allegations, many of them obviously bad
and some knowingly false, but all of which had to be answered (many in the end
found no place in RPHB). The Respondents breached disclosure obligations (see
CRB 10-11; CPHB 2, 10), and raised new arguments at late stages. For example, the
Claimants were right to object to the potential new points in the list at RRB 69 (not in
the end pursued). Another example of the Respondents’ obstructive approach is their
refusal to agree to any additional documents even in obviously legitimate cases. The
Tribunal admitted many of the proposed additions, for example, in its orders of 27
October 17 and 29 December 2017. Worst of all was the Respondents’ conduct of
their case in a vague, shifting manner which increased costs as the Claimants had to
guess the case they had to meet and respond to numerous possibilities. Had the
Respondents advanced a limited range of targeted, clear and unvarying allegations of
breach, the costs of this arbitration for both parties would have been substantially
lower.”"4?

The Respondents, in their Cost Submission, list their costs as follows:

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 110 of 116

(i) Costs and expenses of the Republic of Serbia

- Costs of legal counsel EUR 248,963.08!
- LCIA administrative expenses GBP 100,000

- Costs of expert witness services EUR 102,000

- Other expenses (travel, accommodation etc.) EUR 23,651.92
Total: EUR 374,615 and GBP 100,000

(ii) Costs and expenses of Zelezara Smederevo d.o.0.

- Costs of legal counsel EUR 243,292.65
- LCIA administrative expenses GBP 10,000
- Other expenses (travel, accommodation etc.) EUR 10,854.32 and

GBP 11,344.93

Total: EUR 254,146.97 and GBP 21,344.93

456. The Respondents further make the following submissions:

“Taking the above in to account, Respondents request the following: that the Claim
ants are obliged to reimburse the Republic of Serbia the costs incurred in these
arbitration proceedings within 15 days from receipt of the award, in total amount of
EUR 374,615 and GBP 100,000;

that the Claimants are obliged to reimburse Zelezara Smederevo d.o.0. the costs
incurred in these arbitration proceedings within 15 days from receipt of the award, in
total amount of EUR 254,146.97 and GBP 21,344.93."

457. Having carefully considered the Parties’ submissions on cost, the Tribunal makes the

following decision.

458. First, regarding the costs of the arbitration other than the legal or other expenses
incurred by the Parties (the “Arbitration Costs”), Article 28.1 of the LCIA Rules provides
that they “shall be determined by the LCIA Court in accordance with the Schedule of Costs”
and that “[t]he parties shall be jointly and severally liable to the LCIA and the Arbitral

Tribunal for such Arbitration Costs.”

459. According to Article 28.1 of the LCIA Rules, the NET arbitration costs have been
determined by the LCIA Court as follows:

414 RCS, at para. 2.

- 106 -

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 111 of 116

Registration fee: GBP 1,750.00
LCIA’s administrative charges: GBP 20,254.34
Tribunal’s fees: GBP 213,507.10
Total costs of arbitration GBP 235,511.44

These fees and expenses are subject to the applicable VAT.
460. Article 28.2 of the LCIA Rules further states:

“The Arbitral Tribunal shall specify by an award the amount of the Arbitration Costs
determined by the LCIA Court. The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide the proportions in
which the parties shall bear such Arbitration Costs (in the absence of a final
settlement of the parties’ dispute regarding liability for such costs). If the Arbitral
Tribunal has decided that all or any part of the Arbitration Costs shall be borne by a
party other than a party which has already covered such costs by way of a payment to
the LCIA under Article 24, the latter party shall have the right to recover the
appropriate amount of Arbitration Costs from the former party.”
461. The Tribunal decides that the Parties should bear the NET Arbitration Costs in equal
shares, ie the Claimant should bear GBP 117,755.72 and the Respondents should bear
GBP 117,755.72. The Second Claimant, as the only Party liable to pay VAT (having not
confirmed to the LCIA that it holds a valid EU VAT Registration number) shall bear the
VAT on the Arbitration Costs in the amount of GBP 11,510.22. Given that the Claimants
have paid the Registration fee, deposits and interest accrued in the amount of GBP
124,385.83 and the Respondents have paid deposits and interest accrued in the amount of
GBP 122,623.80, the Claimants shall pay to the Respondents the sum of GBP 4,868.08 (i.e.
the Respondents’ payment of GBP 122,623.80 minus the Respondents’ share of
GBP 117,755.72).

462. Second, regarding the Parties’ legal or other expenses (the “Legal Costs”), Article
28.3 of the LCIA Rules provides:

“The Arbitral Tribunal shall also have the power to decide by an award that all or part
of the legal or other expenses incurred by a party (the “Legal Costs”) be paid by
another party. The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide the amount of such Legal Costs on
such reasonable basis as it thinks appropriate. The Arbitral Tribunal shall not be
required to apply the rates or procedures for assessing such costs practised by any
state court or other legal authority.”

- 107 -

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 112 of 116

463. Article 28.4 of the LCIA Rules further provides:

“The Arbitral Tribunal shall make its decisions on both Arbitration Costs and Legal
Costs on the general principle that costs should reflect the parties’ relative success and
failure in the award or arbitration or under different issues, except where it appears to
the Arbitral Tribunal that in the circumstances the application of such a general
principle would be inappropriate under the Arbitration Agreement or otherwise. The
Arbitral Tribunal may also take into account the parties’ conduct in the arbitration,
including any co-operation in facilitating the proceedings as to time and cost and any
non-co-operation resulting in undue delay and unnecessary expense. Any decision on
costs by the Arbitral Tribunal shall be made with reasons in the award containing such
decision.”
464. In light of the above, and pursuant to Article 28.4 of the LCIA Rules, the Tribunal
decides that the award of the Parties’ Legal Costs should reflect the Parties’ relative success
and failure in this arbitration. While the Tribunal is minded to also take into account the
Parties’ conduct in the arbitration, including any co-operation in facilitating the proceedings
as to time and cost and any non-co-operation resulting in undue delay and unnecessary
expense, the Tribunal finds that in the present case no Party or side was responsible more

than the other for any undue delays or incurred costs in the proceedings.

465. Based on the Parties’ relative success and failure in the award or arbitration, the Legal

Costs are awarded as follows.

466. Regarding the First Respondent, the Claimants’ claims were unsuccessful, and the
Claimants are thus ordered to pay the First Respondent’s Legal Costs. The Claimants’
arguments that the First Respondent should nevertheless be found liable for costs because
“[t]he Respondents forced the Claimants to bring proceedings by refusing to pay which was
RoS’s decision as was the decision to terminate”*"> is unsubstantiated and unconvincing: it
fails for the same reasons the Claimants’ claims against the First Respondent failed in the
first place.“© Given that the claims in this arbitration were brought by both Claimants, both
Claimants are jointly and severally liable for the First Respondent’s Legal Costs. The
Claimants are thus ordered to pay to the First Respondent the amount of EUR 374,616.

467. Regarding the Second Respondent, the Claimants’ claims were partially successful:

“15 CCS, at para. 2.
416 See above at paras 394-419,

- 108 -

Case 1:18-cv-01773-RDM Document 3-1 Filed 07/31/18 Page 113 of 116

a. The Claimants initially sought declaratory relief that “the purported
termination of the MSA by the [Second Respondent] was invalid” and requested that
the Second Respondent was ordered to pay a termination fee to the Claimants under

Clause 8.3.2 of the MSA —a claim the Claimants later withdrew.‘

b. On the Privatisation Bonus claim, the Claimants succeeded on principle, but

not on the amount, and not regarding the Second Claimant.*"®
c. On the Management Fee claims, the Second Claimant succeeded."

468. In light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Second Claimant should be able to
recover 80% of its Legal Costs, which reflects the relative success of its claims in this
arbitration. The amount of the Second Claimant’s Legal Costs is deemed to be

GBP 1,390,639 (being the total of the Claimants’ costs minus the LCIA advance of

GBP 111,750, taken into account as part of the Arbitration Costs above). The Tribunal sees
no reasons to further distinguish between the First Claimant’s and Second Claimant’s Legal
Costs, since there is no evidence that the Claimants’ cost would have been any different had

the claims only been brought by the Second Claimant.

469. The Party liable for the Claimants’ costs is the Second Respondent, since the First
Respondent was found not to be liable vis-a-vis the Claimants on any of the claims listed
above.° The Claimants’ argument that “[bJoth Respondents should be ordered to pay the
Claimants’ costs jointly and severally, even if, hypothetically, liability is found only against
the Company”?! is unconvincing: it fails for the same reasons the Claimants’ argument for

joint and several liability on the main claim failed, as detailed above.’

470. Accordingly, the Second Respondent is ordered to pay to the First Claimant
GBP 1,112,511.20, ie. 80% of GBP 1,390,639.

417 See above at paras 130-134.

418 See above at paras 361-392; 420-428.
419 See above at paras 429-436.
