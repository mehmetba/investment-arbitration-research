Case 1:16-cv-00661 Document1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 2 of 12

Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of
Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments; (ii) entering judgment in Petitioner’s
favor against Respondent in the amount of the Award plus pre- and post-Award interest awarded
therein, post-judgment interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961, and the costs of this proceeding;
and (iii) awarding Petitioner such other and further relief as this Court may find just and proper.
Parties, Jurisdiction, and Venue
1. The Arbitration was seated in Washington, D.C. and the Award was rendered in
Washington, D.C. Petitioner brings this proceeding under Chapters 1 and 2 of the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seg. (the “FAA”) and the United Nations Convention for the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, 330
U.N.T.S. 38 (the “New York Convention”) to confirm a final arbitration award issued in its favor
and against Respondent in its entirety.
2. Petitioner Crystallex is a gold mining company incorporated in Canada, with its head
office in Toronto, Ontario. Petitioner’s registered address is 8 King Street East, Suite 1201,
Toronto, Ontario MSC 1B5.
3. Respondent the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is a foreign state within the meaning of
the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1441(d), and 1602-11.
4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(a) because a foreign state does not enjoy sovereign immunity from a proceeding brought
to confirm: (i) an arbitral award where “the arbitration takes place or is intended to take place in
the United States,” 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6)(A); or (ii) an arbitral award that “is or may be
governed by a treaty or other international agreement in force for the United States calling for the

recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards,” 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6)(B). The place of the

Case 1:16-cv-00661 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 3 of 12

arbitration and the Award was Washington, D.C. and, because the arbitration concerned property
expropriated in Venezuela and an international treaty (inter alia), the Award is subject to the
New York Convention, which is in force in the United States. See 9 U.S.C. § 201.
5. This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to
9 U.S.C. § 9, because it is “the United States court in and for the district within which” the
Award was made, as well as pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 203, which provides that any “proceeding
falling under the [New York] Convention shall be deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of
the United States,” and, consequently, under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.
6. This Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over the Respondent pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(b).
7. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §§ 9 and 204 and 28 U.S.C.
§ 1391(f)(4).

The Arbitration Agreement
A. Respondent’s Consent to Arbitration
8. As set forth in the Award at paragraphs 445 through 457, Respondent consented to
arbitrate its disputes with Canadian investors such as Petitioner through a bilateral investment
treaty, the July 1, 1996 Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of
the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the “BIT’’), which
entered into force on January 28, 1998.7
9. Respondent’s consent is found at Article XII of the BIT. Specifically, Article XII(5)

provides:

* Lacovara Decl., Ex. 2.

Case 1:16-cv-00661 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 4 of 12

Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission

of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this

Article.
10. Respondent is defined in the BIT as a “Contracting Party.” See BIT at | (referring to
“Tt]he Government of Canada and the Government of Venezuela, hereinafter referred to as the
‘Contracting Parties”). As is further set out below and in the Award at paragraphs 445 through
457 and 471 through 484, Petitioner submitted its claim to arbitration in accordance with the
provisions of Article XII of the BIT and the tribunal had jurisdiction over the dispute. Article
XII(5) therefore represents Respondent’s written consent to arbitration.
B. Petitioner’s Consent to Arbitration
11. The Award notes that it is undisputed that Petitioner is a protected investor under the BIT
with the right to commence arbitration against Respondent. Article I(g)(ii) of the BIT defines an
“investor” to include “any enterprise incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with
applicable laws of Canada, who makes the investment in the territory of Venezuela and who does

not possess the citizenship of Venezuela.” Article I(a)(i) of the BIT defines an “enterprise” to
include “any entity constituted or organized under applicable law, . . . including any corporation
....” Petitioner is a corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada. Article I(f) of the BIT
defines an “investment” to mean “any kind of asset owned or controlled by an investor of one
Contracting Party either directly or indirectly . . . in the territory of the other Contracting Party in
accordance with the latter’s laws.” This definition includes “movable and immovable property
and any related property rights,” id. art. I(f)(i), and “rights, conferred by law or under contract, to

undertake any economic and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate,

extract or exploit natural resources,” id. art. I(f)(vi). See Award {J 426-27.

Case 1:16-cv-00661 Document1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 5 of 12

12. As the Tribunal found, Petitioner’s investment-based claims against Respondent were
properly submitted to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules® in
accordance with Article XII of the BIT. See id. {{[ 445-57, 471-84.

13. Under Article XII(3) of the BIT, an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration if it has:
(i) consented in writing thereto; (ii) waived its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings
in certain alternative forums in relation to the alleged breach of the BIT; and (iii) initiated the
arbitration within three years of the date on which the investor acquired (or should have
acquired) knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge of incurred loss or damage.*

14. The Tribunal found that Petitioner satisfied each of these requirements. Id. { 484. On
November 24, 2008, Petitioner delivered to Venezuela a Notice of Dispute,” in which Crystallex
expressed its unconditional consent pursuant to Article XII(3) of the BIT to submit the dispute to
arbitration. On February 16, 2011, Petitioner confirmed that no other related proceedings were
pending before the courts or tribunals of Venezuela and waived its right to initiate any such
proceedings. See Crystallex International Corporation v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
Request for Arbitration, 16 February 2011 (‘Request for Arbitration”)
{ 127.° Both of these documents were filed within the specified three-year time period, which
began in April 2008. See id. { 126; Award J 455.

15. The Tribunal noted that it was undisputed that Petitioner properly commenced arbitration
under the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules. Award J 427. Article XII(4)(b) of the

BIT provides that an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration under the ICSID Additional

* Lacovara Decl., Ex. 3.

* Article XII(3) also requires an investor to satisfy additional conditions if the matter involves taxation. See BIT art.
XII(3)(c). As the Arbitration did not concern matters of taxation, this requirement did not apply to Petitioner.

Facility Arbitration Rules if “either the disputing Contracting Party [Venezuela] or the
Contracting Party of the investor [Canada], but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention.” At
the time the Arbitration was initiated, Venezuela was a party to the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, also known as the “ICSID
Convention,” but Canada was not.’

Summary of the Underlying Dispute
16. Petitioner is a gold mining company incorporated in Canada.
17. Petitioner’s claims in the Arbitration arose from Venezuela’s breach of its BIT
obligations towards the Petitioner’s investment in the Las Cristinas project (“Las Cristinas”), one
of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world. Award {J 6, 878. Las Cristinas is located
in Venezuela’s Bolivar State. Jd. J 6.
18. Petitioner acquired the rights to develop Las Cristinas in 2002 through a Mine Operating
Contract (“MOC”) entered into between itself and the Corporacién Venezolana de Guayana
(“CVG”), a Venezuelan government agency. The CVG is controlled by the Venezuelan Ministry
of Mines. See id. J 16-18.
19. As the Tribunal found, Crystallex invested hundreds of millions of dollars to make Las
Cristinas “shovel-ready,” and to comply with social and community obligations associated with
the project. See id. J] 912-15; see also id. {J 21-42.
20. However, before work on the construction of the mine could commence, Venezuela

abruptly announced that it would not provide Crystallex with the final permit needed. Jd. {{[ 43-

T See Lacovara Decl., Ex. 6, International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, List of Contracting States
and other Signatories of the Convention 1, 5. Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012.
See id. at 5. Under Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, Venezuela’s denunciation did “not affect the rights or
obligations . . . arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of [ICSID] given . . . before” that denunciation. Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, art. 72, opened for
signature March 18, 1965, 17 U.S.T. 1270, 575 U.N.T.S. 159.

 

Case 1:16-cv-00661 Document 1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 7 of 12

45. Three years later, following numerous announcements by the Venezuelan President of his
plan to take control of the Las Cristinas mine, Venezuela terminated the MOC, complaining that
Crystallex had ceased work on the project for more than one year — even though it was the
refusal to issue a permit which caused Crystallex to be unable to proceed. See id. {{[ 50-59. As
explained in the Award:
[T]he conjunction and progression of acts performed by different [Venezuelan]
governmental organs, starting from the actions surrounding the denial of the
Permit, continuing with the announcements that Venezuela would “take back”
Las Cristinas, and ending with the repudiation of the MOC, had the effect of
substantially depriving Crystallex of the economic use and enjoyment of its
investment, and ultimately rendered it entirely useless.
Id. 1708.
The Arbitration
21. Petitioner commenced the Arbitration by submitting a Request for Arbitration to ICSID,
which ICSID received on February 17, 2011. Award 64; see Request for Arbitration. The
Request for Arbitration was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID, pursuant to the ICSID
Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, on March 9, 2011.8 Award q 65.
22. In the Request for Arbitration, Petitioner charged Respondent with multiple breaches of
its obligations under the BIT and requested an award of restitution of Crystallex’s investments,
compensation plus interest, other relief as the Tribunal considered appropriate, and the legal fees
and costs incurred by Petitioner in the arbitral proceedings. See Request for Arbitration J 140.
23. A three-member arbitral Tribunal was constituted on October 5, 2011. Award { 68. Dr.
Laurent Lévy, a Brazilian and Swiss national, was appointed President of the Tribunal with the

agreement of both parties. Professor John Y. Gotanda, Dean of Villanova University School of

Law and a United States national, was appointed arbitrator by Petitioner, and Justice Florentino
Feliciano, a Filipino national, was appointed arbitrator by Venezuela. Jd. { 67.

24. Respondent was represented by counsel throughout the Arbitration, namely the Attorney-
General of Venezuela and attorneys based in Washington, D.C. from the law firm of Foley Hoag
LLP. Id. 14.

25. The legal seat of the Arbitration was Washington, D.C. Jd. 71.

26. The first session of the Tribunal was held in Washington, D.C. on December 1, 2011. Id.
q 70.

27. The Tribunal held a partial hearing on jurisdiction and the merits from November 11
through November 18, 2013. Jd. { 110.

28. On November 18, 2013, part-way through the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits,
Venezuela filed a proposal seeking to disqualify its own appointed arbitrator, Justice Feliciano.
Id. J 113. The Arbitration was immediately suspended. On December 11, 2013, Justice
Feliciano resigned from the Tribunal. Jd. J 115.

29. The Tribunal was reconstituted on December 19, 2013. Jd. { 117. Its members were Dr.
Laurent Lévy as President, Professor John Gotanda, and Professor Laurence Boisson de
Chazournes, a French and Swiss national appointed by Venezuela to fill the vacancy left by
Justice Feliciano. Id. {{[ 116-17.

30. From February 16 through February 19, 2014, the Tribunal held the remainder of the
hearing on jurisdiction and the merits. /d. { 120. On November 22, 2014, the Tribunal held an

additional hearing on quantum (i.e., damages). Id. J 148.

Case 1:16-cv-00661 Document1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 9 of 12

31. The proceedings were declared officially closed on December 24, 2015. Jd. 7 157. By
that time, as the Tribunal noted in the Award, Venezuela had waived or abandoned any of its
objections to the procedural fairness of the arbitration. Jd. { 167.
32. The Tribunal issued the Award on April 4, 2016. The Tribunal’s ruling was unanimous.
33. The Tribunal’s unanimous Award was the culmination of an arbitration proceeding that
lasted over five years. During that time, the parties submitted over 2000 pages of written
pleadings, 23 witness statements, 20 reports by damages and other experts, and over 1900
exhibits and legal authorities. The parties also participated in eleven days of hearings, at which
they made legal submissions and cross-examined witnesses before the Tribunal.
The Arbitral Award

34. The resulting Award is 264 pages long and consists of 961 separate, numbered
paragraphs.
35. The dispositive section of the Award finds, in relevant part, that “Venezuela has breached
Article II(2) of the Treaty by failing to accord the Claimant’s investments in Venezuela fair and
equitable treatment,” and that “Venezuela has breached Article VII(1) of the Treaty by
expropriating the Claimant’s investments in Venezuela.” Award { 961.
36. The Tribunal concluded that Venezuela’s conduct with respect to Petitioner’s investment

was not due to a bona fide dispute about the Parties’ obligations under the MOC

or its performance by Crystallex. It was devised to give effect to [Venezuela’s]

unconcealed political agenda in respect of mining generally, and the Las Cristinas

mine in particular. The termination [of the MOC], for which the statements of

Venezuela’s President and Ministers provided the true rationale, was an attempt

by Venezuela to “recover the mine”, without payment of any compensation.
Id. J 705.

37. The Award orders Venezuela to pay to the Petitioner compensation for its Treaty breach

in the amount of $1.202 billion; plus pre-award interest “at the rate of the 6-month average U.S.

Case 1:16-cv-00661 Document1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 10 of 12

Dollar LIBOR + 1%, compounded annually,” calculated from April 13, 2008 until April 4, 2016;
and post-award interest “at the rate of the 6-month average U.S. Dollar LIBOR + 1%,
compounded annually,” calculated from April 4, 2016 until the date of full payment. Id. { 961.

The total amount owed by Venezuela under the Award amounts at present to approximately $1.4

billion.
38. Petitioner has requested that Venezuela pay the Award but Venezuela has failed to do so.
39. The Award was rendered in Washington, D.C., and arose out of a legal relationship that

is commercial within the meaning of the New York Convention. The Award is non-domestic
within the meaning of Article I(1) of the New York Convention and 9 U.S.C. § 202. See supra
4.
40. Pursuant to Article XII(10) of the BIT, the Award is “final and binding” on Venezuela.
In addition, Article 52(4) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules provides that an
award “shall be final and binding on the parties.” The Award is therefore final and binding
within the meaning of the New York Convention and Chapters | and 2 of the FAA.

THE AWARD MUST BE CONFIRMED
Al. Petitioner repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs | through 40 as if set forth
fully herein.
42. Section 9 of the FAA provides that if an award is not vacated, modified or corrected, “the
United States court in and for the district” where the award was made “must grant” an order
confirming that award. See 9 U.S.C. § 9. The Award has not been vacated, modified or
corrected. None of the grounds for vacatur of the Award enumerated in 9 U.S.C. § 10 or for

modification of the Award enumerated in 9 U.S.C. § 11 apply in this case.

Case 1:16-cv-00661 Document1 Filed 04/07/16 Page 11 of 12

43. Section 207 of the FAA provides that a court “shall confirm” an award covered by the
New York Convention “unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or
enforcement of the award specified in [the New York] Convention.” 9 U.S.C. § 207. None of
the New York Convention grounds for denying recognition and enforcement of an award apply
wane 9

in this case.

44. Article IV of the New York Convention provides that a party applying for recognition
and enforcement of an award “shall, at the time of the application, supply: (a) [t]he duly
authenticated original award or a duly certified copy thereof; [and] (b) [t]he original agreement
[to arbitrate] referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof.” A copy of the Award, as
authenticated and transmitted by the arbitral tribunal, is accordingly submitted herewith.

45. The parties’ agreement to arbitrate is found in Article XIII of the BIT and in Petitioner’s
submission of its claim to arbitration by accepting the standing offer to arbitrate investors’ claims
found in the BIT.'° See supra 17 8-15.

46. For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner is entitled to an order confirming, recognizing, and
enforcing the Award pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §§ 9 and 207, as well as pursuant to Article IV of the
New York Convention.
