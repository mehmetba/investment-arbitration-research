SCC No. 088/2004 Final Award 2/3

 

1.
On December 6, 2004, the Arbitral Tribunal received the file from the Appointing Author-
ity,

2.
On May 3, 2005, the Arbitral Tribunal issued a Preliminary Award setting the seat of the
arbitration in Paris, France.

3.
On March 27, 2007, the Arbitral Tribunal issued a Partial Award conceming all other ques-
tions in the arbitration except the arbitration costs.

4.
The present award is the Final Award in this arbitration concerning the arbitration costs
only. The procedural history was set out in detail in the Partial Award of March 27, 2007.

5.
The Arbitration Costs (Arbitrators! fees at the agreed hourly rate, and expenses, using the
exchange rates of March 26, 2007) are EUR 856,719.50.

6.

The Arbitral Tribunal adopts a “broad brush” costs-follow-the-outcome approach to the
allocation of arbitration costs, which is what many arbitral tribunals do, no matter where
they sit. This does not mean that the winner on balance takes all. On the contrary, it
means that the costs must be borne in proportion to the outcome. The Arbitral Tribunal
takes into account that the Czech Republic fails with its plea of lack of jurisdiction and its
lack of its arbitrability defence and that the "high mark" of Eastern Sugar’s claims, princi-
pal only, was EUR 109,078,000. It allocates 30% of the arbitration costs to the Czech Re-
public and 70% to Eastern Sugar.

7.
Consequently, Eastern Sugar shall reimburse to the Czech Republic 20% of the arbitration
costs, that is EUR 171,343.90.

8.

Both sides made equal advances of EUR 500,000 plus CHF 20,000, each, totalling EUR
1,000,000, plus CHF 40,000. The EUR advance was put into an interest-bearing account
which yielded EUR 22,854.93, bringing the total EUR advance up to EUR 1,022,854.930.

9.
The unused balance is EUR 166,135.43 plus CHF 40,000.

10.
The Parties shall receive equal reimbursement of half of the balance, thus EUR 83,067.71
plus CHF 20,000 each.
