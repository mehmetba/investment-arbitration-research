INTRODUCTION

This case concerns the application for annulment (the “Application”) of the award
rendered on 28 July 2015 in the arbitration proceeding between Bernhard von Pezold and
others and the Republic of Zimbabwe (ICSID Case No ARB/10/15) (the “von Pezold
Award” or the “Award’) rendered by an arbitral tribunal composed of the Honourable L.

Yves Fortier, Mr Michael Hwang, and Prof David A.R. Williams (the “Tribunal’).

The applicant on annulment is the Republic of Zimbabwe (“Zimbabwe” or the
“Applicant”). The respondents on annulment are Bernhard Friedrich Arnd Riidiger von
Pezold, Elisabeth Regina Maria Gabriele von Pezold, Anna Eleonore Elisabeth Webber
(née von Pezold), Heinrich Bernd Alexander Josef von Pezold, Maria Juliane Andrea
Christiane Katharina Batthyany (née von Pezold), Georg Philipp Marcel Johann Lukas von
Pezold, Felix Alard Moritz Hermann Kilian von Pezold, Johann Friedrich Georg Ludwig
von Pezold, Adam Friedrich Carl Leopold Franz Severin von Pezold (the “WPBs” or the

“Respondents,”' and together with the Applicant, the “Parties’).

The Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

Zimbabwe filed simultaneously an application for annulment of the award rendered on
28 July 2015 in the arbitration proceeding between Border Timbers Limited, Timber
Products International (Private) Limited, and Hangani Development Co. (Private) Limited
(the “Border Claimants”) and the Republic of Zimbabwe (ICSID Case No ARB/10/25)
by the same Tribunal (the “Border Timbers Award,” and together with the von Pezold
Award, the “Awards’).

The Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between
the Republic of Zimbabwe and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the

Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on

' The terms “VPBs” and “Respondents” also include the Border Claimants.

29 September 1995 (the “Germany-Zimbabwe BIT”), the Agreement between the Swiss
Confederation and the Republic of Zimbabwe on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection
of Investments, which entered into force on 15 August 1996 (the “Switzerland-Zimbabwe
BIT”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and

Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”).

The dispute in the original proceeding related to the alleged expropriation by Zimbabwe of

land and other property held by the VPBs.

In the Awards, the Tribunals unanimously found Zimbabwe in breach of the applicable
BITs and ordered it to make restitution to the VPBs as well as pay compensation. The
Awards further stipulated that if restitution was not perfected within 90 days, Zimbabwe

would be obligated to pay additional compensation.

Zimbabwe applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID
Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) the Tribunals were not properly
constituted (Article 52(1)(a)); (ii) manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b)); and (iii)

serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)).

In its Amended and Restated Application for Annulment, which was filed on 7 June 2017,
together with the Applicant’s Memorial on Annulment, the Applicant added a further
ground for annulment, namely that the Award had failed to state the reasons on which it is

based (Article 52(1)(e)).

In the original proceeding, the Parties agreed that the two cases would be heard together,
although they would not be formally consolidated, and that the two Tribunals would render
two separate awards. In Procedural Order No 1 of the annulment proceeding, the
Committees decided that the two cases would continue to be heard together, and that the
Committees shall issue separate decisions in relation to each Award. The present decision

deals with the von Pezold Award.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

THE REQUEST FOR STAY OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD

On 21 October 2015, Zimbabwe filed the Application with the Secretary-General of ICSID.
Zimbabwe’s Application also contained a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID
Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings
(the “ICSID Arbitration Rules”) for a stay of enforcement of the Award until Zimbabwe’s

Application was decided (the “Request for Stay”).

On 2 November 2015, pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the
Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application. On the same date, in accordance
with Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the

enforcement of the Award had been provisionally stayed.

By letter dated 21 December 2015, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 6 and 53,
the Parties were notified that an ad hoc Committee composed of Dr Veijo Heiskanen, a
national of Finland and designated as President of the Committee, Ms Jean Kalicki, a
national of the United States of America, and Professor Azzedine Kettani, a national of
Morocco, had been constituted (the “Committee”). On the same date, the Parties were
notified that Ms Jara Minguez Almeida, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary

of the Committee.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held a first
session with the Parties on 1 February 2016 by teleconference. In addition to the Committee

and the Secretary, participating in the teleconference were:

For the Applicant:

Mr Philip Kimbrough Kimbrough & Associés

Mr Tristan Moreau Kimbrough & Associés

The Honourable Prince Machaya Attorney General of the Republic of Zimbabwe

Ms Fortune Chimbaru Acting Director Civil Division, Attorney General's
Office, Republic of Zimbabwe

Ms Elizabeth Sumowah Legal Advisor, Ministry of Lands and Rural

Resettlement, Republic of Zimbabwe

For the Respondents:

Mr Matthew Coleman Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP
Ms Helen Aldridge Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP
Mr Thomas Innes Steptoe & Johnson UK LLP
Mr Charles O. Verrill, Jr Attorney at Law

On 11 February 2016, the Committee issued Procedural Order No 1 recording the
agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the Committee’s decisions on those
procedural matters where the Parties did not agree. Procedural Order No | provides, inter
alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that
the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris,

France.

Procedural Order No 1 also sets forth the procedural calendar. In particular, Section 15.1 of

Procedural Order No | provides:

The proceedings shall consist of two parts. The first part (“Part I”)
shall deal with the Applicant’s request that the enforcement of the
Awards be stayed for the duration of the annulment proceedings.

The second part (“Part II”) shall deal with the Applicant’s
applications to annul the Awards. Each part of the proceedings shall
consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the
Committees.

On 23 February 2016, the Applicant filed an application requesting the order of provisional
measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules (the “Application for Provisional Measures”). Apart from a request for provisional
measures, the Applicant also sought an interim order to preserve the status quo pending

the Parties’ filing of further observations on the matter.

By letter dated 24 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of
the Committee, informing the Parties of the Committee’s decision to deny the Applicant’s
request for an interim order and inviting the Respondents to submit their response to the
Application on Provisional Measures by 2 March 2016. The Respondents submitted their

response on that date.

On 17 March 2016, the Committee issued a Decision on the Applicant’s Application for
Provisional Measures (the “Decision on Provisional Measures’). The Committee
dismissed the Application for Provisional Measures, while reminding the Parties of their
general obligation to refrain from any conduct that may aggravate the dispute during the

pendency of the annulment proceedings.

Pursuant to Procedural Order No 1, on 4 April 2016, the Applicant filed its Memorial in
Support of Continuing the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards (the “Memorial on Stay”),
together with Exhibits ZA-072 to ZA-113 and Legal Authorities ZALEX-061 to
ZALEX-072.

On 11 June 2016, the Respondents filed their Counter-Memorial on the Stay of
Enforcement of the Awards (the “Counter-Memorial on Stay”), together with Exhibits

VPB-010 to VPB-026 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-018 to VPBLEX-057.

On 1 July 2016, the Applicant filed its Reply on the Stay of Enforcement of the Awards
(the “Reply on Stay”). On 7 July 2016, the Applicant submitted an amended version of its
Reply on Stay, together with Exhibits ZA-114 to ZA-151, including a witness statement of
Dr J.P. Mangudya (Exhibit ZA-121), a witness statement of the Honourable Prince
Machaya (Exhibit ZA-137) and a witness statement of Mr Zvinechimwe Churu (Exhibit
ZA-144), and Legal Authorities ZALEX-073 to ZALEX-077.

On 31 July 2016, the Respondents filed their Rejoinder on the Stay of Enforcement of the
Awards (the “Rejoinder on Stay”), together with Exhibits VPB-027 to VPB-043,
including a witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold (Exhibit VPB-032), and Legal
Authorities VPBLEX-058 to VPBLEX-068.

On 12 September 2016, pursuant to Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and
Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Applicant filed an Application for Provisional
Measures to Exclude Consideration of the Merits in Part I (the “Second Application for

Provisional Measures”).

In accordance with an invitation from the Committee, on 23 September 2016, the

Respondents filed a response to the Second Application for Provisional Measures.

On 13 October 2016, the Committee issued a Decision on the Second Application for
Provisional Measures (the “Second Decision on Provisional Measures”), denying the

Second Application.

On 16 November 2016, the Applicant requested leave from the Committee to file Exhibit
ZA-152 with its Skeleton Arguments on Stay of Enforcement. On 18 November 2016, the
Committee granted the Applicant’s request and instructed the Respondents to file any
observations they might have on that document within five business days of its production.
Later that day, the Respondents filed their Skeleton Arguments on Stay and the Applicant
filed its Skeleton Arguments on Stay, together with Exhibit ZA-152.

On 25 November 2016, the Respondents filed their observations on Exhibit ZA-152 in the
form of Exhibits VPB-044 to VPB-047 and a further witness statement of Mr Heinrich von
Pezold (Exhibit VPB-048).

Following exchanges between the Parties, on 30 November 2016, the Committee granted
the Applicant leave to file an additional witness statement in response to the Respondents’

observations of 25 November 2016.

On 2 December 2016, the Applicant filed an additional witness statement of Dr J.P.
Mangudya (Exhibit ZA-153). Together with the witness statement, the Applicant requested
a procedural ruling from the Committee in advance of the scheduled hearing regarding
alleged hearsay evidence contained in the additional witness statement of Mr Heinrich von
Pezold (Exhibit VPB-048). On 4 December 2016, the Committee invited the Respondents

to comment on the Applicant’s request.

On 6 December 2016, the Respondents filed their comments on the Applicant’s
2 December 2016 request for a procedural ruling from the Committee regarding the alleged
hearsay evidence. The Respondents requested that Exhibit VPB-048 be kept on the record
in its entirety or, should the Committee decide to exclude it, Exhibit ZA-152 be struck from

the record as well.

On 7 December 2016, the President of the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational

meeting with the Secretary of the Committee and the Parties by telephone conference.

33.

During the call, in addition to discussing logistical arrangements for the upcoming hearing

on the stay of enforcement of the Award, the Parties agreed that there was no need for the

Committee to strike portions of Exhibit VPB-048 from the record.

A hearing on the stay of enforcement of the Awards was held in Paris, France, on 14 and

15 December 2016 (the “Hearing on Stay”). In addition to the Members of the Committee

and the Secretary of the Committee, the following individuals were present at the Hearing

On behalf of the Respondents:

Mr Heinrich von Pezold

At the close of the Hearing on Stay, the Parties were instructed to agree on a further, limited
document production procedure. Following exchanges between the Parties, on 19 January
2017, the Respondents sent directly to the Applicant a request that it produce certain
documents and attached to their request Legal Authority VPBLEX-069. On 2 February
2017, the Respondents sent a further communication directly to the Applicant requesting
additional updated information (this letter was subsequently introduced into the record as

Exhibit VPB-050).

On 12 February 2017, the Applicant produced Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155 in response
to the Respondents’ document production request of 19 January 2017. The Applicant stated
that Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155 should “properly inform the Parties without breaching

the Applicant’s confidentiality obligations.”

On 13 February 2017, the Respondents wrote to the Committee stating that they did not
consider the documents produced by the Applicant to satisfy their request for document
production and asked the Committee to determine whether their request had been met. The
Respondents also requested leave from the Committee to make observations and file new
evidence in response to Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155. On 14 February 2017, the

Committee granted the Respondents’ request to make observations and file new evidence.

On 20 February 2017, the Respondents filed a witness statement of Mr Heinrich von Pezold
(Exhibit VPB-049) in response to Exhibits ZA-154 and ZA-155.

By letter of 26 February 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the
Committee, informing the Parties of the Committee’s decision to deny the Respondents’
request for document production, taking note of the Applicant’s refusal to produce the
documents on grounds of confidentiality. The Committee noted that its decision was
without prejudice to the determination, which it would make in due course, as to whether

the Applicant had established the facts that the requested documents allegedly support.

The Applicant filed its Post-Hearing Brief on Stay on 9 March 2017, and the Respondents
filed their Post-Hearing Brief on Stay on 10 March 2017.

On 31 March 2017, the Respondents wrote to the Committee requesting that certain
allegations made in the Applicant’s Post-Hearing Brief on Stay be disregarded. The
Applicant commented on this request by letter dated 6 April 2017. By letter of 10 April
2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee, informing the
Parties that the Committee had decided not to formally disregard the Applicant’s
allegations, and that it would assess the Applicant’s allegations in terms of their relevance

to the Applicant’s request for stay and the evidentiary record of this annulment proceeding.

Following exchanges between the Parties, by letter of 3 April 2017, the ICSID Secretariat
wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee confirming the procedural calendar for

Phase II of the proceedings, pursuant to the timetable set forth in Procedural Order No 1.

THE ESCROW ARRANGEMENT

On 24 April 2017, the Committee issued its Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award
(the “Decision on Stay”).” In its Decision, the Committee: (i) rejected the Applicant’s
request for the continued stay of the enforcement of the Awards; (ii) lifted the provisional
stay of enforcement; (iii) noted that the Applicant had 90 days as of the dispatch of the
Decision on Stay to comply with paragraph 1020.1 of the Award; and (iv) ordered that any
funds paid by the Applicant or collected by the Respondents in consequence of the Award,

and any documents establishing title to the properties specified in paragraph 1020.1 of the

? Annex A to this Decision.

Award and in the Tables referred to therein (the “Claimed Properties”), be placed in

escrow until the conclusion of the annulment proceedings (the “Escrow Arrangement’).

On 3 May 2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No 2, inviting the Parties to advise
the Committee, by 15 June 2017, of the agreement reached and, to the extent there were
any issues on which the Parties were unable to agree, of their respective positions on the

Escrow Arrangement provided for in the Decision on Stay.

As discussed further below, pursuant to the procedural calendar established in Procedural
Order No | and as confirmed by the ICSID Secretariat’s letter of 3 April 2017, on 7 June
2017, the Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment (the “Memorial”), together with
Exhibits ZA-156 to ZA-227, including witness statements of Mr Chrispen Mavodza
(Exhibit ZA-156), Ms Sophia Christina Tsvakwi (Exhibit ZA-157), Ms Virginia Sithole
(Exhibit ZA-158), Mr Onias Claver Masiwa (Exhibit ZA-159), the Honourable Prince
Machaya (Exhibit ZA-160) and Ms Fatima Chakupamambo Maxwell (Exhibit ZA-161),
and Legal Authorities ZALEX-085 to ZALEX-123.

By email of 14 June 2017, the Respondents, on behalf of the Parties, requested that the
15 June 2017 deadline for the Parties’ comments on the Escrow Arrangement be extended

until 23 June 2017. The Committee subsequently granted this extension.

By email of 23 June 2017, the Respondents, on behalf of the Parties, provided an update to
the Committee on the progress made with respect to the Escrow Arrangement and
requested until 29 June 2017 to provide a further update. The Committee subsequently

granted the Parties’ request.

By letter of 29 June 2017, the Respondents submitted a report on the progress and
outstanding issues concerning the Escrow Arrangement, together with Exhibits VPB-051
to VPB-058. By email of the same date, the Applicant transmitted to the Committee a draft
version of the Escrow Arrangement, together with a letter from Mr Philip Kimbrough,
counsel for the Applicant, to Mr Matthew Coleman, counsel for the Respondents. In the

absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Parties requested that the Committee

decide (i) who should be the escrow agent; and (ii) the mechanism for the release of the

sums and/or documents held in escrow.

By letter of 30 June 2017, the Respondents submitted further comments on the Escrow
Arrangement, together with Exhibits VPB-059 to VPB-062. The Applicant responded to

these further comments by letter of 3 July 2017.

By letter of 7 July 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the
Committee with regard to the Escrow Arrangement and in response to the Parties’ request
of 29 June 2017. The Committee directed that (i) the Parties appoint the Escrow Service of
the Office of the Bdtonnier of the Paris Bar as the escrow agent; and that (ii) the Parties
agree on comprehensive directions for release of funds and/or documents held in escrow
that would cover various scenarios. The Committee requested that the Parties report back

on their progress on these issues by 14 July 2017.

By email of 14 July 2017, the Respondents provided an update on the Escrow Arrangement
further to the Committee’s directions of 7 July 2017 and requested until 19 July 2017 to

provide a further update. The Committee subsequently granted the request.

By email of 19 July 2017, the Respondents transmitted to the Committee a revised Escrow
Arrangement including a redline of the edits made to the draft version previously sent by

the Applicant on 29 June 2017.

Also by email of 19 July 2017, the Applicant transmitted to the Committee its observations
on the Escrow Arrangement, together with Exhibits ZA-228 to ZA-234. The Applicant’s
observations also contained a request that the Committee suspend the 90-day restitution

deadline as ordered in the Decision on Stay.

On 20 July 2017, the Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant’s
request to suspend the restitution deadline. The Respondents provided their comments by

a letter of the same date.

By letter of 23 July 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the

Committee with regard to the Applicant’s 19 July 2017 request to suspend the restitution

deadline. The Committee rejected the Applicant’s request, citing a lack of jurisdiction over
the request as this would require the Committee to vary the Awards. The Committee
therefore directed the Parties to provide an update by 7 August 2017 of the agreement
reached or, to the extent that there were any issues on which the Parties had been unable to
agree, of their respective positions on the Escrow Arrangement. Finally, the Committee
stated that, in the absence of an agreement between the Parties by the stated deadline, it did
not envisage granting any further extensions and would make a final decision on the

Escrow Arrangement.

On 25 July 2017, the Applicant filed an Application for Provisional Measures requesting
that the Committees order a temporary stay from 23 July 2017 to five business days
following the opening of the Batonnier Escrow Account (the “Third Application for
Provisional Measures”). The Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the

Applicant’s request by 28 July 2018.

On 28 July 2017, the Respondents submitted their comments on the Third Application for
Provisional Measures, together with Exhibit VPB-063.

By letters of 7 August 2017, pursuant to the Committee’s direction of 23 July 2017, each
Party submitted a status report of the discussions on the Escrow Arrangement. With their

letter, the Respondents included Exhibits VPB-064 to VPB-066.

On 22 August 2017, the Committee issued a Decision on the Third Application for
Provisional Measures (the “Third Decision on Provisional Measures’). In the Decision,
the Committee (i) dismissed the Third Application; (ii) directed the Parties to individually
establish escrow accounts of their own devise, with an internationally reputable bank; and
(iii) directed the Parties to submit their proposed Escrow Arrangements for the

Committee’s prior review and approval by 15 September 2017.

On 15 September 2017, pursuant to the Third Decision on Provisional Measures, each Party
submitted to the Committee its proposed Escrow Arrangement; with their proposal, the
Respondents included Exhibit VPB-067. By email of later that date, the Respondents

objected to the wording of the Applicant’s proposal and suggested alternative language.

61.

62.

63.

64.

66.

The Committee subsequently invited the Applicant to comment on the Respondents’

objection and suggestion by 19 September 2017.

On 19 September 2017, the Applicant confirmed its agreement with the Respondents’
suggested language proposed on 15 September 2017; the Applicant also proposed
additional language in light of Exhibit VPB-067. The Committee subsequently invited the

Respondents to comment on the Applicant’s proposal by 21 September 2017.

On 21 September 2017, the Respondents confirmed their agreement with the Applicant’s

proposed additional language of 19 September 2017.

On 25 September 2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No 3, ordering the Parties
to conclude individual Escrow Arrangements with the Batonnier of the Paris Bar as the
escrow agent, directing that each Party deposit with the Batonnier of the Paris Bar the sums
payable under the Award, until the conclusion of this annulment proceeding, and inviting
the Parties to inform the Committee promptly of any sums deposited to the individual

escrow accounts.

The Committee notes that neither Party has informed the Committee of any sums deposited
on either escrow account during this annulment proceeding. Consequently, and in
accordance with the terms of Procedural Order No 3, the Committee’s directions in
Procedural Order No 3 will lapse upon the issuance of the present Decision, as directed by

the Committee in the operative part of this Decision.

THE APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT

As noted in paragraph 45, the Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment on 7 June 2017.

By email of 5 October 2017, the day before the deadline envisioned in the procedural
calendar for the Respondents’ Counter-Memorial on Annulment (the “Counter-
Memorial’), the Respondents transmitted a letter addressed directly to the Applicant
regarding an alleged breach by the Applicant of the status quo. The letter did not request

any action from the Committee.

On 8 October 2017, two days later than the deadline envisioned in the procedural calendar,
the Respondents filed their Counter-Memorial, together with Exhibits VPB-068 to VPB-
282 and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-070 to VPBLEX-100. The Committee subsequently

invited the Applicant to comment on the Respondents’ late submission by 10 October 2017.

On 10 October 2017, the Applicant submitted its comments on the Respondents’ late
submission of their Counter-Memorial. The Applicant did not object to the admission of
the Counter-Memorial into the record, however it requested that the Committee extend the
deadlines for the remaining pleadings on annulment. The Committee subsequently invited

the Respondents to submit their response to the Applicant’s request by 13 October 2017.

On 13 October 2017, the Respondents provided their response to the Applicant’s request
of 10 October 2017.

By letter of 16 October 2017, the Secretary of the Committee wrote to the Parties on behalf
of the Committee regarding the Applicant’s request of 10 October 2017, informing the
Parties of the Committee’s decision to admit the Counter-Memorial into the record and to

modify the procedural calendar.

By letter of 17 October 2017, the Applicant responded to the Respondents’ letter of
5 October 2017 regarding the alleged breach of the status quo.

By letter of 22 November 2017, the Applicant requested that the deadline to submit its
Reply on Annulment be extended “in light of the recent political developments in
Zimbabwe.” The Committee subsequently invited the Respondents to comment on the

Applicant’s request by 24 November 2017.

By letter of 23 November 2017, the Respondents, on behalf of the Parties, submitted an
agreed amended procedural calendar. The Committee confirmed the amended procedural

calendar on 24 November 2017.

By letter of 29 November 2017, the Respondents informed the Committee that the First
Claimant in ICSID Case No ARB/10/15, Mr Riidiger von Pezold, had passed away. The

75.

Respondents subsequently filed a Power of Attorney in respect of Mr Riidiger von Pezold’s

estate on 7 April 2018.

Pursuant to the amended procedural calendar, on 16 January 2018, the Applicant filed its
Reply on Annulment (the “Reply’”). On 22 January 2018, the Applicant submitted an
amended version of its Reply, together with Exhibits ZA-235 to ZA-312, including witness
statements of Ms Virginia Sithole (Exhibit ZA-306), Mr Onias Claver Masiwa (Exhibit
ZA-307), the Honourable Prince Machaya (Exhibit ZA-308) and Ms Fatima
Chakupamambo Maxwell (Exhibit ZA-309), as well as an additional witness statement of
Ms Fatima Chakupamambo Maxwell (Exhibit ZA-237), and Legal Authorities
ZALEX-124 to ZALEX-217.

By letter of 6 February 2018, the Applicant requested directions from the Committee in
advance of the hearing and informed the Committee of its intention to reach an agreement
on certain matters with the Respondents. By email of that same date, the Respondents
stated that the matters referred to by the Applicant should be addressed after the last

pleading had been filed.

By email of 8 February 2018 transmitted by the ICSID Secretariat, the Committee
acknowledged the Parties’ communications of 6 February 2017 and proposed a date and
time for the pre-hearing teleconference. Included with the email was a draft agenda on
which the Committee invited the Parties’ comments by 14 February 2018; this deadline

was subsequently extended to 7 March 2018.

Also by email of 8 February 2018, the Applicant requested that “the Committees [...] direct
‘that [new evidence which was not filed in the original arbitrations] will not be considered
by the Committees and should not be filed in the first instance.’” The Committee
subsequently invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant’s request by 9 February

2018.

By letter of 9 February 2018, the Respondents commented on the Applicant’s request of
8 February 2018.

By letter of 12 February 2018, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the
Committee regarding the Applicant’s request of 8 February 2018. The Committee denied
the Applicant’s request, noting that while Section 16.2 of Procedural Order No | provides
that the Committee expects that “the parties will primarily refer to the evidentiary record
of the arbitration proceedings,” evidence not submitted in the arbitration proceedings is not

as such inadmissible in these annulment proceedings.

Pursuant to the amended procedural calendar, on 5 March 2018, the Respondents filed their
Rejoinder on Annulment (the “Rejoinder’), together with Exhibits VPB-283 to VPB-317
and Legal Authorities VPBLEX-101 to VPBLEX-119.

On 7 March 2018, the Respondents submitted their comments on the proposed draft agenda

for the pre-hearing teleconference; the Applicant submitted its comments on 8 March 2018.

On 9 March 2018, the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the

Secretary of the Committee and the Parties by telephone conference.

By letter of 10 March 2018, the Applicant submitted to the Committee a response to an
alleged new argument made by the Respondents during the pre-hearing organizational
meeting. By email of 11 March 2018, the Respondents sought leave from the Committee

to respond to the Applicant’s letter.

Later on 11 March 2018, by email transmitted by the ICSID Secretariat, the Committee
informed the Parties that it had been sufficiently briefed on the matter, and that the Parties
should refrain from submitting further comments unless invited to do so by the Committee.
Accordingly, the Committee denied the Respondents’ request for leave to respond to the

Applicant’s 10 March 2018 letter.

By letter of 12 March 2018, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties on behalf of the
Committee regarding the organization of the upcoming hearing on annulment, including a

deadline for the Parties to exchange Skeleton Arguments on Annulment.

On 20 March 2018, pursuant to the Committee’s letter of 12 March 2018, the Parties filed

their Skeleton Arguments on Annulment.

THE AWARD

THE CLAIMS

The dispute that was the subject matter of the original arbitration arose out of the Land
Reform Program (“LRP”) implemented by the Government of Zimbabwe through a series
of measures that were first introduced after the independence of Zimbabwe in 1979. The
aim of the LRP was to acquire (initially on a willing buyer-willing seller basis but
subsequently allowing compulsory transfers) agricultural land from large-scale farms for
purposes of resettlement.* However, the implementation of the LRP was hampered, inter
alia, by lack of funds to compensate land owners and progress was slow in the first ten

years of independence.

On 15 July 2000, the Government introduced a Fast Track Land Reform Program
(‘FTLRP”), which, inter alia, removed compensation provisions for agricultural land

acquired compulsorily by the State. The introduction of the FTLRP also marked the

3 Award (VPB-174), para 97.

99.

beginning of the “invasions” by settlers of predominantly white-owned farms, including
those owned by the VPBs.* In 2005, the Constitution of Zimbabwe was amended to acquire
and vest in the State title to land which had been previously identified as being subject to
the LRP. No compensation was payable for such land and persons having any right or
interest in the land were prohibited from applying to the court or challenging the acquisition

of the land by the State.*

The VPBs, through the Border Claimants, owned three estates in Zimbabwe (the
“Estates’’): (i) the Forrester Estate, “essentially a tobacco growing and curing operation set
on 22,000 ha of land [...] in the North of Zimbabwe;””® (ii) the Border Estate, “an integrated
forestry plantation comprising 28 properties with pine and eucalyptus (gum) plantations
[...] and three sawmills set on 47,886 ha of land and located in [...] the East of
Zimbabwe;”” and (iii) the Makandi Estate, “a mixed plantation, growing coffee, bananas,
maize, macadamia nuts, avocados, and timber for the production of transmission poles, set

on 8,389 ha and spread across nine properties [...] in the East of Zimbabwe.”*

The VPBs stated that, as a result of the 2005 constitutional amendment, Zimbabwe had
compulsorily acquired all but ten properties they owned, without any compensation. They
also submitted that the remaining ten properties were not viable on their own and had thus
been rendered worthless. They further alleged that before being formally acquired by
Zimbabwe, invasions took place on the Estates, causing much damage while the police and

armed forces failed to properly intervene and protect white farmers.

The VPBs alleged that, as a result of the events summarized above, Zimbabwe had
breached Articles 4(2) (expropriation), 2(1) (fair and equitable treatment), 2(2) (non-
impairment), 4(1) (full protection and security) and 5 (free transfer of payments) of the

Germany-Zimbabwe BIT, as well as Articles 6(1) (expropriation), 4(1) (fair and equitable

THE PROCEDURE BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL

On 11 June 2010, ICSID registered a Request for Arbitration filed by the VBPs.

On 3 December 2010, ICSID registered another Request for Arbitration filed by the Border

Claimants.

Pursuant to the agreement between the Parties, two identically composed Tribunals were
constituted to rule on both claims in two conjoined arbitration proceedings. The Tribunals
were subsequently reconstituted three times, following resignations of members appointed

by Zimbabwe.

At the first procedural joint session held on 7 February 2011, Zimbabwe indicated that it
did not intend to object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Parties agreed that

they would exchange two rounds of submissions on the merits of the VPBs’ claims.

On 31 October 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1, ruling on document

production requests.

On 15 November 2011, the VPBs submitted their Memorial on the Merits.

On 26 June 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 2, which dismissed applications
to participate as non-disputing parties submitted by the European Centre for Constitution

and Human Rights and four indigenous communities of Zimbabwe.

On 11 August 2012, Zimbabwe filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.

On 12 October 2012, the VPBs filed their Reply on the Merits and Ancillary Claims.

On 14 December 2012, Zimbabwe, now represented by new counsel, submitted its
Rejoinder on the Merits, including Objections to Jurisdiction to the Claimants’ Original

Claim and Observations on Ancillary Claims.

20

110.

111.

112.

113.

On 11 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 3, which disposed of an
application by the VPBs, inter alia, to strike out jurisdictional challenges and other
defenses allegedly raised for the first time by Zimbabwe in its Rejoinder on the Merits,
despite its submissions to the contrary during the first procedural joint session. In
Procedural Order No 3, the Tribunal admitted Zimbabwe’s jurisdictional objections into
the record, acknowledging “special circumstances” within the meaning of ICSID
Arbitration Rule 26(3). The Tribunal further joined Zimbabwe’ jurisdictional challenges
to the merits and vacated the previously set hearing dates to accommodate further briefing

on the new issues.

On 1 March 2013, the VPBs filed their Observations on the Rejoinder and a Response to

Observations on Ancillary Claims.

On 16 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 4, which addressed the VPBs’
application for an order for provisional measures, alleging that intruders had entered their
properties in Zimbabwe. The VPBs requested that the Tribunal order Zimbabwe to instruct
its police forces either (i) to prevent intruders from entering the Estates; or (ii) if intruders
had already entered the Estates, to remove them. In Procedural Order No 4, the Tribunal
dismissed the VPBs’ application. First, the Tribunal acknowledged Zimbabwe’s statement
that it had instructed its police to maintain the status quo on the Estates as at the date of the
filing of the Request for Arbitration. Second, the Tribunal acknowledged Zimbabwe’s
undertaking to instruct its police forces to act upon any report on intrusion into the VPBs’
properties. The Tribunal noted that the VPBs themselves had stated that Zimbabwe’s forces
had already removed most of the intruders and helped the VPBs to restore damaged or
stolen property. However, the Tribunal instructed the Parties not to aggravate the dispute

further and to maintain the status quo until the resolution of the dispute.

On 3 April 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 5, addressing an application by
the VPBs for urgent interim relief. The VPBs alleged that Zimbabwe’s Central Intelligence
Office was planning to assassinate one of the Claimants, Mr Heinrich von Pezold. By
Procedural Ordered No 5, the Tribunal ordered Zimbabwe to implement immediately, in

cooperation with VPBs, measures of protection to ensure Mr Heinrich von Pezold’s safety.

21

114.

115.

116.

117.

118.

119.

The Tribunal also ordered Zimbabwe to report periodically on the implementation and

effectiveness of such protection measures.

On 19 April 2013, Zimbabwe filed its Response to Observations on the Rejoinder
(“Rebutter’).

On 15 May 2013, the VPBs submitted an updated request for relief and introduced a

correction to the quantum of their claims.

On 22 July 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 6, addressing a further request
for provisional measures advanced by the VPBs, which was prompted by the entry of new
intruders into the properties. In Procedural Order No 6, the Tribunal dismissed the
application on the basis, inter alia, that the VPBs had failed to adduce evidence warranting
the wide-ranging measures requested and to show emergency and necessity, as required

under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1).

On 8 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 7, addressing the VPBs’
objections to (i) Zimbabwe’ new jurisdictional objection, allegedly raised for the first time
on 19 April 2013; and (ii) the new evidence submitted in support of the objection. After an
exchange of submissions on this issue, the Tribunal dismissed the VPBs’ objections and

amended the briefing schedule to allow for the objection to be pleaded by both Parties.

On 15 August 2013, Zimbabwe filed its Re-Rebutter (i.e., an addendum to its 19 April

2013 Response to Observations on the Rejoinder).

On 9 September 2013, the VPBs filed a Response to the Re-Rebutter. Together with this
pleading, the VPBs submitted Exhibit C-858, which is a letter dated 12 November 1992
from the Merchant Bank of Central Africa Limited to Tanks Group Services Limited. The
letter describes an approval given by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for Tanks
Consolidated Investment Limited (a Bahamian subsidiary of the Belgian bank, Société
Générale de Belgique) to transfer a Zimbabwean company (then-named “Tanks
Investments (Zimbabwe) Ltd,” and from 24 August 1999 named “Franconian Zimbabwe
Investments (Pvt) Ltd”) (‘“Franconian”)) from Tanks Consolidated Investments Ltd to

another subsidiary of Société Générale de Belgique, Saxonian Estates Ltd of Jersey

22

120.

121.

122.

123.

(“Saxonian’”). In their 9 September 2013 Response to the Re-Rebutter, the VPBs stated
that Exhibit C-858 constituted evidence of approval of one of their investments by the

Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.

On the same day, 9 September 2013, Zimbabwe filed observations on the Claimants’

15 May 2013 updated request for relief and corrected quantum.

On 25 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 8, following Zimbabwe’s
request to extend the page limit of its 26 September 2013 submission, in order to allow it
to properly reply to the VPBs’ three new arguments raised in their 9 September 2013
Response to the Re-Rebutter. In Procedural Order No 8, the Tribunal reminded Zimbabwe
that it had been afforded ample opportunity to plead its case at all stages of the proceedings.
The Tribunal also recalled its decisions in (i) Procedural Order No 3, whereby Zimbabwe’s
jurisdictional objections were all admitted on the record despite its previous undertakings
not to file jurisdictional objections; and (ii) Procedural Order No 7, whereby the Tribunal
allowed additional jurisdictional arguments to be raised belatedly. In the circumstances,
the Tribunal was not prepared to reopen Procedural Order No 7 and dismissed the

Respondent’s request for a page limit extension.

On 26 September 2013, Zimbabwe filed its Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter (i.e.,
a response to the VPBs’ 9 September 2013 submission). Zimbabwe’s submission was
accompanied by a second witness statement from Mr Grasiano Nyaguse and a third witness
statement from Mr Onias Masiiwa. Zimbabwe argued that Exhibit C-858 showed that (i)
the VPBs were aware that approval from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe was required for
the acquisition of their investments; and that (ii) the VPBs could not show that all of their
investments had been approved. Zimbabwe also indicated that Exhibit C-858 related to a
transaction between two subsidiaries of Société Générale de Belgique and did not concern

the VPBs.

On the same date, the VPBs filed their response to Zimbabwe’s 9 September 2013

submission.

130.

On 2 October 2013, Zimbabwe applied to the Tribunal, inter alia, to seek confirmation that
its Re-Rebutter Reply and its 9 September 2013 Quantum Reply, and accompanying

evidence, were fully on the record.

On 11 October 2013, the President of the Tribunal and the Parties convened a telephone
conference during which it was agreed that there was no reason to postpone the hearing
scheduled to start on 28 October 2013. Both Parties also made oral submissions on

Zimbabwe's 2 October 2013 application.

On 12 October 2013, Zimbabwe further requested the Tribunal to order the VPBs to submit
any further “approval/illegality exhibits they may have ‘overlooked’ through 10 December

2013.” Zimbabwe also sought leave to reply to any further submission of documents.

Following these two applications, the Parties agreed to the admission of certain material
filed by Zimbabwe with its 9 and 26 September 2013 pleadings, while leaving other

material subject to the determination of the Tribunal.

On 14 October 2013, both Parties filed their Skeleton Arguments.

On 15 October 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 9. The Tribunal found that
the approval/illegality objections raised by Zimbabwe in its 26 September 2013 Reply to
the Response to the Re-Rebutter (which raised the alleged illegality of all of the VPBs’
investments for failure to comply with Zimbabwe’s exchange control regulations) had been
expanded in breach of the Tribunal’s directions contained notably in Procedural Order
Nos 3 and 7. The Tribunal determined that there were no “special circumstances”
warranting the admission into the record at such a late stage of this expanded version of
Zimbabwe's objections. The Tribunal also ruled that certain passages in the two witness
statements filed by Zimbabwe with its Re-Rebutter Reply, which addressed the wider
version of its illegality objection, should be redacted, while several other documents also

filed with the submission would not be admitted into the record.

From 28 October to 2 November 2013, a hearing on jurisdiction, liability and quantum was
held in Washington, D.C. As discussed further below, on Day 4 of the hearing, Mr Yves

Fortier, the President of the Tribunal, mentioned that he was currently acting as chairperson

24

of the World Bank Sanctions Board, and inquired whether either Party would have any
issue if the secretary of the Sanctions Board sat in on that day’s proceedings. Separately
from this issue, Zimbabwe contends in this annulment proceeding that during the
examination of witnesses at the hearing, the President of the Tribunal made allegedly

inappropriate or biased comments to Zimbabwe’s witnesses.

On 24 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 10, which dealt with the
Parties’ proposed corrections to the hearing transcript. The Tribunal also admitted into the
record material submitted by Zimbabwe in response to questions formulated during the
hearing. Procedural Order No 10 also set out the procedure for post-hearing submissions

and denied a further request by Zimbabwe for an extension of time.

On 7 May 2014, both Parties submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs.

On 6 June 2014, the VPBs filed a Statement on Inadmissible Material Contained in

Zimbabwe’ s Post-Hearing Brief.

On 2 July 2014, Zimbabwe submitted its Response to the Statement on Inadmissible
Material. In its submission, Zimbabwe also made a number of procedural requests relating
to (i) the admissibility of several of the VPBs’ submissions which allegedly raised new
arguments and contained new evidence; and (ii) Zimbabwe’s right to file an additional

submission on these new issues.

On 9 July 2014, the VPBs filed their Reply to Zimbabwe’s Response to the Statement on

Inadmissible Material.

On 15 July 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 11. The Tribunal indicated that

it required no further briefing on Zimbabwe’s 2 July 2014 submission.

On 5 September 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 12, in which it denied the
last five procedural requests made by Zimbabwe in its 2 July 2014 pleading, including its
request to be allowed to file a further brief on the alleged new arguments raised by the
Claimants. The Tribunal also reserved its decision on the first five procedural requests for

the Award.

On 20 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on whether it should issue
a single award or two separate awards. Zimbabwe supported the former approach, while

the Claimants preferred the latter option.

On 1 December 2014, the Parties submitted their Submission on Costs and Fees.

On 18 December 2014, the Parties submitted their Reply Submissions on Costs and Fees.

On 23 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 13, ruling that two awards
should be rendered. Although the Tribunal found that the claims were fundamentally
intertwined, it held that since the von Pezold and Border Claimants had elected to file two

separate claims, they were entitled to pursue enforcement of any award independently.

On 3 February 2015, the Tribunal declared the proceedings in both cases closed, in
accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).

THE AWARD

The Tribunal rendered its Award on 28 July 2015.

The Award deals with fifteen separate issues, with numerous sub-issues, relating to: (i) the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the VPBs’ investments under both the Germany-Zimbabwe
BIT and the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT; (ii) Zimbabwe’s approval and illegality
objections to the admissibility of the claims; (iii) attribution to Zimbabwe of conduct of
settlers and of political statements of the President of Zimbabwe and of certain Government
officials; (iv) proportionality, regulation and margin of appreciation; (v) the alleged
expropriation of the VPBs’ investments; (vi) the alleged breach by Zimbabwe of the fair
and equitable treatment standard; (vii) the alleged impairment by Zimbabwe of the VPBs’
investments; (viii) the alleged breach by Zimbabwe of the full protection and security
standard; (ix) the alleged breach by Zimbabwe of the free transfer of payments standard;
(x) Zimbabwe’s necessity defense; (xi) the alleged lack of causation between Zimbabwe’s
conduct and the VPBs’ loss; (xii) remedies available to the VPBs under the BITs; (xiii)
interest applicable in case compensation was awarded; (xiv) the VPBs’ requests for

declaratory relief; and (xv) costs of arbitration.

The Tribunal upheld its jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, noting that
(i) it was not contested that the case involved a legal dispute within the meaning of
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention;° and that (ii) Zimbabwe had consented to the
submission of the dispute to the Centre.!? The Tribunal also upheld its jurisdiction ratione
personae as well as its jurisdiction ratione materiae under both the ICSID Convention!!
and the BITs.!? The Tribunal also found jurisdiction ratione temporis under the Germany-
Zimbabwe BIT (which Zimbabwe only challenged under that Treaty, but not under the
Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT).'*

The Tribunal then turned to Zimbabwe’s objections to admissibility based on the alleged
lack of approval and illegality of the VPBs’ investments (the “Approval Objection” and
the “Ilegality Objection,” respectively), noting that Zimbabwe had presented its
objections regarding the legality of the VPBs’ investments and their approval as objections
to admissibility rather than to jurisdiction.'* The Tribunal determined to treat Zimbabwe’s
objections as admissibility objections, consistent with Zimbabwe’s pleadings, but noted

that the characterization of the objections was immaterial to its decision.'>

In view of the seriousness of the arguments made by Zimbabwe in its Post-Hearing Brief
regarding alleged procedural abuse and violation of its right to be heard, the Tribunal
reviewed in detail the procedural history of the case. The Tribunal considered it “vital for
its unanimous determination that PO No 9 should be reconfirmed again,” and it so

decided.!°

As to Zimbabwe’s Approval Objection, which was based on Article 9(b) of the Germany-

Zimbabwe BIT, the Tribunal noted that the provision appeared to conflict with Ad Article

2(a) of the Protocol to the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT. Article 9(b) appeared to require
formal approval of investments, while Ad Article 2(a) did not contain any such
requirement. Relying on the general rule of treaty interpretation in Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Tribunal concluded that there was no specific

requirement of approval.!”

The Tribunal further found that Zimbabwe was in any event
estopped from denying that it had given approval to the VPBs’ investments, if approval

was required. '* Accordingly, the Tribunal dismissed Zimbabwe’s Approval Objection.

149. As to the Illegality Objection, the Tribunal found that it was not convinced that the VPBs
had breached any of Zimbabwe’s laws, but even if they had, the Respondent was estopped

from denying that BIT protection existed.'?

150. | The Tribunal then dealt with two of Zimbabwe’s remaining 2 July 2014 requests relating
to the alleged new evidence given by Mr Riidiger von Pezold during his examination at the
hearing, to the effect that Exhibit C-858 related to the VPBs’ investments. Zimbabwe had
applied for an opportunity to file further submissions on that alleged new evidence, but the
Tribunal had reserved its decision for the Award. The Tribunal agreed with the VPBs that
Mr Riidiger von Pezold had simply misconstrued the letter and found that his statement did

not constitute new evidence warranting further pleadings from Zimbabwe.”

151. | The Tribunal went on to dismiss most of Zimbabwe’s arguments on attribution, concluding
that the conduct of State organs was attributable to the State, except if performed in purely
private capacity, which issue did not arise in this case.”! The Tribunal dismissed the VPBs’

argument that the actions of the settlers were attributable to the State.

28

152. The Tribunal also dismissed Zimbabwe’s arguments on the applicability of the doctrine of
proportionality and margin of appreciation,” noting that neither doctrine could be used to

justify illegal conduct based on racial discrimination.”*

153. On the merits, the Tribunal upheld the great majority of the VPBs’ claims, finding that
Zimbabwe had (i) unlawfully expropriated the VPBs’ investments, including those which
had not been formally seized but had been rendered worthless as a result of the
expropriation of other properties.7* The Tribunal also held that Zimbabwe had breached
(ii) the fair and equitable treatment standards in Article 2(1) of the Germany-Zimbabwe
BIT and Article 4(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT; (iii) the non-impairment
standard in Article 2(2) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 4(1) of the
Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT;”° (iv) the full protection and security standard in Article 4(1)
of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 4(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT;7’ and
(v) the free transfer of payments standard in Article 5 of Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and

Article 5 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT.”8

154. The Tribunal rejected Zimbabwe’s necessity defense, finding that it did not meet the
requirements of Article 25 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the “ILC Articles”), which the
Parties agreed governed the issue. More specifically, the Tribunal noted that Zimbabwe
had not declared a state of emergency at the relevant time, and that the settlers constituted
a minority of the overall citizenry; accordingly their actions “were of a scale that was not

992

uncontrollable by the Government and the police forces.”?? On the contrary, “the

Zimbabwean Government chose to inflame the situation rather than dissolve it through

legal means.”*? Zimbabwe had thus failed to demonstrate a threat to the essential interests

of the State.

155. The Tribunal also found, in connection with Zimbabwe’s necessity defense, that the land
occupations by the settlers did not constitute a threat to the survival of the State and
accordingly the measures taken by Zimbabwe had not been taken to save Zimbabwe of a
“grave and imminent peril.”*! The Tribunal further ruled that the measures taken by
Zimbabwe were not the “only way” to deal with the unrest at hand,*? and that its conduct
was racially motivated and breached “its obligation erga omnes not to engage in racial
discrimination.”** As a result, Zimbabwe’s conduct constituted ‘‘an impairment to the
international community as a whole and ILC Article 25(1)(b) precludes a defense of

necessity [in such a case].”*+

156. Finally, further in connection with Zimbabwe’s necessity defense, the Tribunal held that
Zimbabwe “not only contributed to its economic decline and but was also one of the
primary instigators of the situation.”*> Accordingly, Zimbabwe could not invoke the

necessity defense in Article 25 of the ILC Articles.*©

157. Having found Zimbabwe liable for breaches of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and the
Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Tribunal ordered Zimbabwe to restitute the VPBs’ assets
that had been unlawfully expropriated and awarded compensation to the VPBs for “land
damage and losses of productivity,” to achieve full reparation.*” The Tribunal further
awarded the von Pezold Claimants, should restitution occur, compensation in the amount
of US$ 56,710,037. Should restitution not occur within the restitution window fixed by the

Tribunal, the von Pezold Claimants were amounted compensation for their loss in the

amount of US$ 186,814,861. The Tribunal further awarded the von Pezold Claimants the
amount of US$ 7,186,302 in reimbursement of loans contracted by the von Pezold
Claimants and the repayment of which had been impeded by Zimbabwe. The Tribunal also
awarded US$ 1,000,000 in moral damages to Mr Heinrich von Pezold.*8

Finally, the Tribunal awarded pre-award and post-award compound interest, while ordering
Zimbabwe to pay to the von Pezold Claimants 92% of the costs and expenses of the

arbitration.”

GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT: SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The Applicant seeks the annulment of the Award, in its entirety, on eight separate grounds.
These eight grounds are formulated on the basis of four of the five grounds of annulment
in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the Tribunal was not properly constituted
(Article 52(1)(a)); (ii) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (iii)
there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d));

and (iv) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).

This Section sets out a summary of the Parties’ positions on the eight annulment grounds
relied upon by the Applicant (and as formulated by the Applicant). The Parties’ positions
are addressed in more detail in Section V, which deals with the Committee’s decisions.
GROUND 1: SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE—DENIAL
OF RIGHT TO BE HEARD ON THE ILLEGALITY OBJECTION (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))

(qd The Applicant’s Position

The Applicant submits that it has been denied the right to be heard on its jurisdictional

objections, including the supporting evidence.

More specifically, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal, by way of Procedural Order
Nos 7, 8 and 9, wrongly excluded the evidence relating to its jurisdictional objections,

which challenged the legality of the Respondents’ investments.*”

First, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal, in Procedural Order No 7, afforded it
insufficient time to argue properly its jurisdictional objections.*! In Procedural Order No 8,
the Tribunal refused the Applicant’s request to extend by three to four pages the page limit
applicable to its reply submissions on the issue.*” Finally, in Procedural Order No 9, the
Tribunal allegedly unduly restricted the Applicant’s right to address and respond to the
issues raised by the relevant evidence, specifically Exhibit C-858.*? The Applicant in
particular complains of the Tribunal’s decisions in Procedural Order No 9 (i) to refuse its
submission of evidence responsive to Exhibit C-858 and (ii) to order the redaction of
several paragraphs included in three of its witness statements and expert reports which

dealt with issues raised by Exhibit C-858.*4

The Applicant contends that Procedural Order No 9 was also influenced by the bias of
Mr Yves Fortier, the President of the Tribunal, towards the Applicant and to his belatedly
disclosed role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board.*° The Applicant argues
that, due to his bias, Mr Fortier attributed the majority of the delays in the proceedings
solely to the Applicant and ensured, through Procedural Order No 9, that the schedule
would not be derailed by the Applicant’s jurisdictional objections.*° According to the
Applicant, another telling example of the President’s bias was the limited consideration

given to the Applicant’s submissions at the hearing to reconsider Procedural Order No 9.*”

165. According to the Applicant, the President’s bias is further evidenced by his Kaplan lecture
on corruption issues in international arbitration, delivered when the arbitration proceedings
were still pending. The Applicant submits that the lecture confirms that Mr Fortier
prejudged the issues in the arbitration by attributing responsibility for corruption mainly to
government officials, which made him more receptive to the Respondents’ arguments that

the Applicant’s officials were corrupt when implementing the LRP.**

166. Inthe Applicant’s view, as a result of these events, it was deprived of its fundamental right
to be heard and accordingly the Award stands to be annulled under Article 52(1)(d) of the
ICSID Convention.

(2) The Respondents’ Position

167. The Respondents deny that the Award breached Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.
In particular, they argue that the Applicant has not shown that it was effectively deprived
of its right to be heard. Indeed, according to the Respondents, the scope of the right to be
heard is not without limits; it only requires that the parties be given a fair and reasonable
opportunity to present their case, within the procedural limits determined by the arbitral
tribunal. Consequently, when the Tribunal ruled that the Applicant’s evidence and
arguments relating to its Illegality Objection were raised out of time and were inadmissible,
the Applicant was not deprived of the right to be heard as it had been given sufficient

opportunity to plead its case but failed to take advantage of it.”

168. The Respondents argue that, in any event, the Applicant has failed to show that even if a
departure from a fundamental rule of procedure occurred, it was so serious as to warrant
annulment of the Award.*’ According to the Respondent, it is only if, but for the alleged

departure, the outcome of the Award would have been substantially different, that such

departure could be considered serious.>! According to the Respondents, the Applicant has

failed to meet the required threshold for annulment.

The Respondents further contend that decisions such as Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9
cannot be reviewed on annulment since an ICSID tribunal is the sole judge of admissibility

and probative value of evidence.*?

The Respondents deny what they describe as the unsupported allegations of bias or
prejudgement on the part of Mr Fortier when dealing with the Applicant’s requests to

adduce untimely and inadmissible evidence.

In particular, the Respondents highlight that in Procedural Order No 7, the Tribunal granted
the exact time the Applicant requested, while permitting it to plead its legality Objection

out of time.*?

Likewise, according to the Respondents, the Tribunal’s decision in Procedural Order No 8
to refuse the Applicant’s request for an extension of the page limit was justified. Indeed, in
its decision, the Tribunal rejected the Applicant’s contention that the request was warranted
to allow it to respond to new arguments raised by the Respondents as the admittedly new
arguments were raised, in accordance with Procedural Order No 7, in response to the
Applicant’s own unauthorized submissions on approval and illegality. As a result, the

Tribunal did not agree to the Applicant pleading these issues any further.**

Finally, as to Procedural Order No 9, the unredacted sections of the witness statements and
expert reports targeted by the redaction order still stood as rebuttal evidence to Exhibit
C-858 [ZA-45].>> The Respondents further note that although the Tribunal, in Procedural
Order No 9, excluded the Applicant’s latest pleading on the Illegality Objection as having

been filed out of time, it accepted into the record nineteen out of the 21 documents that

were submitted in support.°°

In conclusion, according to the Respondents, the President of the Tribunal dealt with the
Applicant’s many vexatious motions fairly and enforced the applicable procedural rules in
an even-handed fashion.*” As a result, the Applicant was not deprived of its right to be

heard and there is no basis to annul the Award.

GROUND 2: SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE—
DEPRIVING ZIMBABWE OF THE RIGHT TO CONSIDER, BE HEARD AND IMPLEMENT
DISQUALIFICATION IN A MEANINGFUL TIME AND MANNER BEFORE CLOSURE OF
RECORD (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))

(qd The Applicant’s Position

The Applicant’s submissions on the second ground of annulment focus on the timing and
the manner in which the President of the Tribunal disclosed his role as chairperson of the

World Bank Sanctions Board.

Notably, the Applicant contends that the late disclosure by the President of his role, made
in passing on Day 4 of the final hearing in the original arbitration, deprived it of sufficient

time to consider and apply for his disqualification.**

The late disclosure also meant that a disqualification application would have been
meaningless. Even if the Applicant had succeeded in disqualifying the President on the
basis of his late disclosure, this would have had only a prospective effect. It would not have
allowed for the correction of the decisions that the Tribunal had already taken, which had
been tainted by the President’s bias, and in any event, the evidentiary record was effectively

closed at the end of the hearing, soon after the disclosure. 59

As a result, even if the Applicant had been allowed enough time to consider and apply for

disqualification of the President before the record was closed, this would not have provided

an effective remedy. In the circumstances, the Applicant argues that the only efficient

remedy is the annulment of the Award.

(2) The Respondents’ Position

The Respondents contend that the President of the Tribunal was under no duty to disclose

his involvement with the World Bank Sanctions Board, for three main reasons.

First, the President’s position as chairperson of the Sanctions Board does not have any
bearing on his impartiality and independence in the arbitration. The World Bank Sanctions
Board is an autonomous entity within the World Bank, and the chairperson of the Sanctions

Board is not a World Bank employee.*!

Second, according to the Respondents, the Sanctions Board can only apply sanctions on
private entities. It has no authority to impose sanctions on States, State entities or public

officials.

Third, the Respondents note that the subject matter of the arbitration had nothing to do with
the international sanctions that had been imposed on Zimbabwe. The Tribunal referred to
“sanctions” only in three contexts: (i) to determine the public purpose of the expropriation
of the Respondents’ investments as the measures were taken in the context of international
sanctions applied mainly by the United States of America and the European Union; (ii) to
deal with an argument relating to the foreign exchange rate proposed by the Respondents;

and (iii) to address the Applicant’s state of necessity defense.

The Respondents submit that the Applicant waived its right to rely on the President’s
alleged non-disclosure in these annulment proceedings as it failed to challenge him during

the arbitration, or indeed in a timely manner under ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1).

The Respondents point out that, had the Applicant succeeded in disqualifying the President
during the arbitration, it could have applied to the re-constituted tribunal to reopen any
procedural decisions issued by the earlier tribunal that it believed might have been
tainted.® Indeed, the Applicant did frequently seek to reopen unfavorable procedural
decisions during the arbitration, which shows that in its own view reopening of such

decisions was in principle possible.

The Respondents insist that in any event the record of the arbitration was not in any way
tainted or biased.® The Tribunal’s decisions were based on the facts and they were soundly

reasoned.

In conclusion, in the Respondents’ view, the Tribunal did not depart from a fundamental

tule of procedure and accordingly there is no basis to annul the Award.

GROUND 3: TRIBUNAL NOT PROPERLY CONSTITUTED—ARBITRATOR LACK OF
IMPARTIALITY, BOTH PERCEIVED AND REAL, RAISING DOUBTS ON MR FORTIER’S
INDEPENDENCE AND NEUTRALITY IN HIS ROLE AS PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNAL
(ARTICLE 52(1)(A))

(qd The Applicant’s Position

The Applicant’s third ground of annulment is also based on Mr Fortier’s alleged late
disclosure of his role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board. According to the
Applicant, Mr Fortier was under a continuing obligation to disclose any circumstance
“likely to give rise to justifiable doubts” as to his reliability to exercise independent
1.

judgment.®” His failure to disclose his role in a timely fashion (that is, as soon as he had

been appointed as chairperson of the Sanctions Board in May 2012)” created justifiable

doubts as to his impartiality.”!

The Applicant points out that Mr Fortier’s role as chairperson of the Sanctions Board was
incompatible with his function as the President of the Tribunal. Since Zimbabwe was
subject to a variety of international sanctions and these were referred to frequently during
the proceedings, Mr Fortier could not sit, at the same time, as a chairperson of a sanctioning
body and as President of the Tribunal.’? His role on the Sanctions Board made him also a
contractor of an entity (the World Bank) which itself had repeatedly imposed sanctions on

Zimbabwe.”

The Applicant also argues that Mr Fortier’s partiality transpired on numerous occasions
during the arbitration, e.g., when he issued Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9,74 and when
he made allegedly inappropriate comments to the Applicant’s witnesses during the

hearing.”

Accordingly, Mr Fortier’s function on the Sanctions Board, coupled with the specific
factual and procedural background of the arbitration, created reasonable doubt as to his
independence and impartiality towards the Applicant. As a result, the Applicant concludes

that the Tribunal was not properly constituted, and the Award should be annulled.

(2) The Respondents’ Position

The Respondents submit that the Applicant has failed to discharge its burden of proof that
the President’s role as chairperson of the Sanctions Board created a manifest lack of
impartiality or independence which had a material effect on the outcome of the arbitration.

Notably, according to the Respondents, a reasonable third party would not have considered

it “obvious and highly probable” that the President lacked independence or impartiality

because of his parallel function.”

The Respondents argue that, in any event, Mr Fortier’s alleged lack of impartiality or
independence did not have any material effect on the outcome of the arbitration as the
Award was unanimous, and neither of the other two members of the Tribunal was ever

challenged by Zimbabwe.””

For the reasons summarized in paragraphs 177 to 180 above, the Respondents insist that
the President of the Tribunal was under no duty to disclose his position as chairperson of
the Sanctions Board. Indeed, his role would not have created in the eyes of a reasonable
person any justifiable doubts as to his reliability to exercise independent judgment, as the

Sanctions Board’s competence does not extend to States and public officials.’

Likewise, for the reasons summarized in paragraphs 181 to 184 above, the Respondents
reiterate that the Applicant waived its right to rely on Mr Fortier’s dual role to seek

annulment of the Award as it failed to lodge a challenge against him during the arbitration.

Finally, the Respondents contend that the Applicant’s allegations as to Mr Fortier’s alleged
procedural bias and impropriety are misplaced. The numerous procedural decisions taken
by the Tribunal which are now challenged by the Applicant on annulment were fair and

GROUND 4: SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE—
MR FORTIER’S AND THE TRIBUNAL’S FAILURE TO PROPERLY DISCLOSE HIS ROLE AS
CHAIRPERSON OF THE WORLD BANK SANCTIONS BOARD (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))

qd) The Applicant’s Position

According to the Applicant, both the third and the fourth ground of annulment refer to the

same facts but are based on different legal grounds—whereas the third ground refers to

39

Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention (the Tribunal was not properly constituted), the
fourth ground is based on Article 52(1)(d) (serious departure from a fundamental rule of
procedure). In particular, the Applicant contends that the President’s duty to disclose any
issue which could give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence is a

“fundamental rule of procedure.”®°

197. The Applicant contends that the President failed to abide by this fundamental rule of
procedure when failing to disclose “in a meaningful time and manner” to the Parties his
role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board.*! As a result, the Award should be

annulled.

(2) The Respondents’ Position

198. The Respondents deny that the duty to disclose qualifies as a fundamental rule of
procedure. In the Respondents’ view, only the arbitrator’s duty to remain impartial and
independent, which forms part of the “principles of natural justice,” qualifies as such.*?
Accordingly, even assuming Mr Fortier did fail to abide by his duty to disclose, he
remained independent and impartial throughout the proceedings and therefore did not
breach any fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the

ICSID Convention.**

199. The Respondents also insist, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 177 to 180 above, that
Mr Fortier was under no duty to disclose his position as chairperson of the World Bank
Sanctions Board. Similarly, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 181 to 184 above, the
Applicant waived its right to rely on Mr Fortier’s dual role and therefore cannot seek

annulment of the Award.

GROUND 5: TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS—FAILURE TO APPLY THE
LAW TO THE APPLICANT’S EMERGENCY / NECESSITY DEFENSE WHILE RELYING ON
ZIMBABWEAN LAW REGARDING DECLARATION OF STATE OF EMERGENCY (ARTICLE
52(1)(B))

ie jicant’s Position
1 The Appli °s Positi

According to the Applicant, the Tribunal failed to apply, or applied erroneously, the

applicable law on three separate occasions.

First, the Tribunal should not have applied Zimbabwean law to determine whether a state
of emergency existed in Zimbabwe at the relevant time. Instead, it should have applied

customary international law, as reflected in particular in the ILC Articles.*+

Second, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to apply Ad Article 3(a) of the
Protocol to the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT.*° According to the Applicant, this provision
should have been considered by the Tribunal as a non-precluded measures clause. As such,
it exonerated the Applicant from any liability for measures taken to safeguard public
security and order. As a result, and by the operation of this provision, the Applicant should
not have been held liable for the LRP, which was implemented to protect public security

and order.*°

Third, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to apply (or applied erroneously)
Articles 7(1) and 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT.*’ In particular, the Tribunal

* Amended and Restated Application for Annulment, paras 390-392; Memorial, paras 450-453; Tr Day 1, 132:5-22.

85 Ad Article 3(a) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT Protocol provides, in part, that “Measures necessary for reasons of
public security and order, public health or morality shall not be deemed ‘treatment less favourable’ within the meaning
of Article 3” (VPBLEX-021).

8 Memorial, paras 442-444.
87 Article 7(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT reads:

Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other
Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution,
a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the territory of the
latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party
treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other
settlement, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party
accords to its own investors or investors of any other State whichever is more
favourable to the investor concerned. Resulting payments shall be freely
transferable.

should have applied these provisions to the effect that the Applicant’s obligations to
provide full security and to indemnify investors would have been “nullified or at least

suspended.”**

2 The Respondents’ Position
Pp

The Respondents note, first, that the Tribunal applied Article 25 of the ILC Articles, which
reflects customary international law, and not Zimbabwean law in determining whether the

Applicant could invoke the necessity defense to excuse itself from liability.®

Second, the Respondents argue that Ad Article 3(a) of the Protocol to the Germany-
Zimbabwe BIT does not exclude measures taken for reasons of public security and order
from compliance with the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT.” Instead, it
relates to the State’s obligation to provide national treatment and most-favored nation

(“MFN”’) treatment to foreign investors.

Moreover, the Tribunal did not fail to consider and apply Ad Article 3(a). Indeed, the
Tribunal referred to the provision several times in the Award, when addressing the VPBs’
claim for breach of the BIT’s fair and equitable treatment standard.?! The Respondents
note, in this connection, that the Applicant’s characterization of Ad Article 3(a) as a treaty-
based necessity defense (or non-precluded measures clause) was expressly rejected by the

Tribunal.°”

Article 7(2) of the same BIT reads:

Without prejudice to paragraph (1) of this Article, investors of one Contracting
Party who in any of the situations referred to in that paragraph suffer losses in
the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:

(a) requisitioning of their property by its forces or authorities, or

, which was not
'y of the situation,

(b) destruction of their property by its forces or authoritie
caused in combat action or was not required by the necess

 

 

shall be accorded restitution or adequate compensation. Resulting payments shall
be freely transferable (VPBLEX-023).

Third, as to Article 7(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Respondents argue that the
Tribunal did apply the provision and rejected Zimbabwe’s position.” In any event,
Zimbabwe did not refer to Article 7(1) in the context of its necessity argument but rather
argued that the provision should excuse it from its obligation to provide full protection and

security in the event of national emergency.”

As to Article 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Respondents argue that
Zimbabwe never explicitly relied on it in the arbitration as a defense, but merely referred
to it in passing to argue that it should be excused from any obligation to compensate foreign

investors due to the necessity of the situation.”

Alternatively, the Respondents maintain that should the Committee find that Zimbabwe
did rely on Article 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, it should find that the Tribunal
dismissed the argument either pursuant to Procedural Order No 3, as it was pleaded out of
time, or because two of its triggering elements were missing (namely, that no state of
emergency existed and that the destruction of the Respondents’ assets was not warranted

by the necessity of the situation).

GROUND 6: TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS—FAILURE TO APPLY
APPLICABLE LAW TO THE VPBS’ CONCEALED FOREIGN INVESTMENT VIOLATIONS AND
PREVIOUSLY WITHHELD INFORMATION AS PROVING THE ILLEGALITY OF THE VPBs’
INVESTMENTS (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))

qd) The Applicant’s Position

Under Ground 6, the Applicant argues that, under Article 9(a) of the Germany-Zimbabwe
BIT” and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Tribunal had to apply

after its entry into force by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting
Party which have been or are: a) made in accordance with the laws of the latter Contracting Party” (VPBLEX-021).

°8 Switzerland-Germany BIT Article 2 provides that “This Agreement shall apply to all investments made before or
after its entry into force by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party which
have been or are made in accordance with the laws of the latter Contracting Party” (VPBLEX-023).

Zimbabwean law to determine the legality of the VPBs’ investments.”? However it failed
to do so, most notably in relation to the requirement to seek the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe’s approval for each and every investment, as required by the Zimbabwean

exchange control regulations. !°°

According to the Applicant, the Tribunal also failed to take into account the Respondents’
admission that their acquisition of one of the companies they controlled was made in breach
of an undertaking made by the former owner of the company to the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe that no change of beneficial ownership in that company would occur in the
future.!°! In view of this undertaking, the subsequent acquisition of the entity by the
Respondents was a breach of the applicable exchange control regulations and thus
illegal. !°?

In the Applicant’s view, as a result, the Tribunal exceeded its powers when finding, in
disregard of the applicable exchange control regulations, that the Respondents’
investments were legal and thus qualified as investments protected under Article 9(a) of

the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT.

(2) The Respondents’ Position

The Respondents agree that the Tribunal indeed did not apply Zimbabwe’s exchange
control regulations to the Respondents’ investments; however, this was entirely appropriate
as Zimbabwe’s argument regarding the alleged illegality of the Respondents’ investments
under the regulations had been dismissed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 9 as
inadmissible. The remaining illegality arguments that were properly on record were dealt

with by the Tribunal in the Award and were dismissed. !°°

The Respondents further contend that, in any event, the Tribunal also rejected the
Applicant’s argument on illegality on the basis that the Applicant was estopped from
arguing that it had not approved the Respondents’ investments.'** Consequently, even
assuming the Tribunal had, in Procedural Order No 9, unjustifiably refused to consider the
wider illegality objection advanced by the Applicant, it would still have dismissed the

objection by way of estoppel.

The Respondents contend that, as a result, the Tribunal’s treatment of Zimbabwe’s
objection in the Award, and the alleged lack of application by the Tribunal of Zimbabwe’s
exchange control regulations, did not have had a material effect on the outcome of the

arbitration. !°°

The Respondents also argue the Applicant failed to raise its legality Objection in a timely
and diligent manner. In particular, once it had received, on 15 November 2011, the
Respondents’ Memorial, which detailed the acquisition of their investments, the Applicant
could have used the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s system to check whether the
Respondents’ investments had been granted the required approvals under Zimbabwean
law.!°° However, the Applicant failed to do so and therefore also failed to challenge the

legality of the Respondents’ investments at an appropriate time.

Furthermore, as to Exhibit C-858 [ZA-045], the Respondents submit that the document
relates to a transaction that did not involve the VPBs but the subsidiaries of their previous
owner, Société Générale de Belgique. '!®’ The letter also does not contain any undertaking
that no change of beneficial ownership would occur in the future; it merely confirms that
the specific transaction will not involve any change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of

the company. !°%

Finally, and in any event, the Respondents argue that the letter does not emanate from the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and therefore does not imply any binding legal opinion that
would engage the exchange control regulations. '°? Consequently, even if the Tribunal had
failed to consider the letter, which is not the case, it would not have manifestly exceeded

its powers by failing to apply the applicable law.!!°

GROUND 7: TRIBUNAL MANIFESTLY EXCEEDED ITS POWERS—ISSUING AN AWARD
WITHOUT HAVING JURISDICTION (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))

ie jicant’s Position
1 The Appli ’s Positi

The Applicant submits that the Tribunal wrongly found jurisdiction over the Respondents’
illegal investments. According to the Applicant, under Article 9(a) of the Germany-
Zimbabwe BIT and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, the Tribunal could only
assert jurisdiction over investments that had been made “in accordance with the laws” of

Zimbabwe.'"!

The Applicant contends that the Respondents’ investments were illegal, as they had not
been approved by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, as required under Zimbabwe’s exchange
control regulations.''* The Applicant maintains that it established the illegality of the
investments in the arbitration, but the Tribunal in Procedural Order No 9 erroneously

dismissed the Applicant’s arguments for procedural reasons.

According to the Applicant, the Tribunal also mistakenly relied on estoppel to assert
jurisdiction over the Respondents’ illegal investments.!> The Applicant submits that
estoppel and waiver cannot serve as a basis of jurisdiction, as these notions are only

relevant to issues of admissibility. The Applicant contends that since jurisdiction trumps

222. The Applicant submits that it could not have lodged its jurisdictional challenge based on

have been aware of the illegality of the Respondents’ investments before they adduced
Exhibit C-858 [ZA-45] into the record.!!® The Applicant accordingly could not have

asserted jurisdiction over the Respondents’ investments on that basis.!!7

ICSID annulment committees, an excess of power can only be manifest if it is evident, that
is, with only one interpretation being possible on the issue in question.!!° In particular, the
Respondents assert that if the relevant reasoning of the tribunal is tenable or arguable, there

cannot be any “manifest excess of power.”!”° According to the Respondents, the reasons

given by the Tribunal on the Applicant’s illegality arguments were evidently tenable and

thus cannot result in the annulment of the Award.

The Respondents argue that several ICSID annulment committees have drastically limited
the scope of review of ICSID tribunals’ jurisdictional decisions on annulment.'?! The
Respondents submit that Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention requires that an excess
of jurisdiction be “obvious, without deeper analysis” for the annulment committee to annul
an ICSID award on this basis.'2? However, since the Applicant is effectively requesting the
Committee to review the Tribunal’s jurisdictional decision de novo, its annulment

application must fail.

As to the Applicant’s estoppel arguments, the Respondents note that the Applicant relies
on the alleged misapplication by the Tribunal of the estoppel principle (i.e., it applied
estoppel in relation to jurisdiction rather than admissibility). However, an erroneous
application of the law cannot lead to an award’s annulment under Article 52(1) of the

ICSID Convention. !7

Moreover, according to the Respondents, the Applicant relies on ICSID annulment
decisions which do not establish that estoppel cannot vest jurisdiction in an ICSID
tribunal. !*4 Finally, and in any event, the Respondents point out that the Applicant did not
put forward the argument regarding the relationship between jurisdiction and admissibility
during the arbitration.'75 Thus, according to the Respondents, the Applicant is precluded

from raising its estoppel arguments in the annulment phase. !7°

GROUND 8: FAILURE OF THE AWARD TO STATE THE REASONS ON WHICH IT IS BASED
(ARTICLE 52(1)(E))

ie jicant’s Position
1 The Appli °s Positi

The Applicant’s eighth ground of annulment is based on the Tribunal’s procedural
decisions dealing with the Applicant’s legality Objection. According to the Applicant, the
Tribunal failed to consider “outcome-determinative questions” relating to the illegality of

the VPBs’ investments.

First, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal, by way of Procedural Order No 9, wrongly
excluded the Applicant’s submissions and evidence relating to the wider illegality
defense—that is, that the VPBs’ investments were all illegal for failure to comply with
Zimbabwe’s exchange control regulations.'2” As a result, the Award failed to consider

Exhibit C-858 and the related jurisdictional objections.

Second, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal contradicted itself by quoting in the Award
in full Zimbabwe’s corrected statement of relief, even if it had previously excluded it from
the record. The Tribunal cannot rely on a document that it has itself decided is not part of

the record. !78

As to the Respondents’ argument that the Applicant’s eighth ground of annulment is time-
barred, the Applicant argues that the elements of its eighth ground “could reasonably be
considered as covered by the statements in the application for annulment” and therefore

2
are not really new grounds.!”

(2) The Respondents’ Position

The Respondents argue that, as a preliminary matter, the Applicant’s eighth ground of
annulment is inadmissible as it was not mentioned in the Applicant’s Annulment
Application. It is therefore time-barred under ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)(iii), which

requires that an application for annulment must “state in detail ... the grounds on which it

28 Memorial, paras 608-609.
29 Reply, para 917.

49

232.

233.

234.

is based.” Therefore, at a minimum, the application must identify the bases under Article 52

of the ICSID Convention which the applicant is invoking.

The Respondents submit that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention only requires that
the reasoning of the challenged award can be followed; it does not require that the reasons
be “appropriate” or “convincing.” *° Nor can an ICSID tribunal be criticized on annulment
for not having considered arguments that the parties did not make in the underlying

arbitration proceeding. '*!

The Respondents submit that the Applicant’s contentions are based on a new, wider
iteration of the Ilegality Objection which it has only developed during the annulment
proceeding. Hence, the Tribunal could not be criticized for having failed to consider an

argument which was never made before it.'**

As to the Applicant’s second argument, the Respondents state that, in quoting the full
request for relief in the Award, the Tribunal was not entertaining the Applicant’s Ilegality
Objection that it had already dismissed repeatedly, most notably in Procedural Order
No 9.'33 Hence, since the relevant requests for relief had already been dismissed
previously, there was no need for the Tribunal to address them again in the Award. There
is therefore no contradiction in the Tribunal’s quoting the full request for relief in the
Award.'™ In any event, even assuming the Tribunal’s reference to the Applicant’s full
request for relief were to be considered a mistake, it could not lead to the annulment of the
Award. According to the Respondents, only reasons which are so contradictory as to cancel
each other out can lead to an annulment of an award under Article 52(1)(e) of the

Convention. '*5

The Respondents insist that the Tribunal did not fail to consider “outcome determinative”
questions relating to the Applicant’s Ilegality Objection. Indeed, these questions were
either not pleaded by the Applicant as such in the arbitration, or the objection, as pleaded
on annulment by the Applicant, had been dismissed as inadmissible by the Tribunal in

Procedural Order No 9.!%6

Finally, the Respondents note that since the Tribunal rejected the Illegality Objection in all
its forms on the basis of estoppel, the treatment of this objection throughout the arbitration
had no material effect on the outcome of the arbitration. In other words, the Respondents
contend that, since the Tribunal ruled that the Applicant was estopped from claiming that
it did not grant the necessary approval to the Respondents’ investments, it would have
dismissed any illegality objection based on lack of approval, regardless of the timing of its

submission by the Applicant. '°7

THE COMMITTEE’S DECISION

THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING ANNULMENT

The legal framework and the legal principles governing ICSID annulment proceedings are
well established in the ICSID Convention and in the jurisprudence of ICSID annulment
committees. The key provision governing annulment is Article 52 of the ICSID
Convention, which provides:

(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an

application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or
more of the following grounds:

(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;
(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;

(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the
Tribunal;

'36 Counter-Memorial, para 486; Tr Day 2, 476:7-13.
87 Counter-Memorial, para 510; Rejoinder, paras 284-286.

Sl

(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental
rule of procedure; or

(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is
based.

238. While Article 52 sets out the annulment grounds in abstract terms, their real test therefore
being in their application, there is a well-established understanding of the legal basis and
the scope of annulment under the ICSID Convention. Thus, the practice of ICSID
annulment committees has confirmed that the grounds of annulment listed in Article 52 are
exclusive, and that it is the applicant that carries the burden of proof in establishing that

any of the annulment grounds it invokes exist.'*8

239. It is also clear from the language of Article 52, and it is well established in ICSID
annulment practice, that annulment is an extraordinary remedy and not an appeal from the
legal or factual findings of the arbitral tribunal.'*? The object and purpose of annulment
proceedings is not to test the substantive correctness of the award; indeed, Article 53(1) of
the ICSID Convention specifically provides that “[t]he award shall be binding on the
parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided
for in this Convention.” Annulment can be successful only if there is a fundamental flaw
in the award, or in the proceeding that led to it, that falls under one or more of the annulment
grounds in Article 52. The function of an ICSID ad hoc committee is not to review the
factual findings of an ICSID tribunal or its decision on the merits, but to determine whether
any of the annulment grounds in Article 52 has been established. Nor is an ICSID
annulment proceeding a retrial and accordingly it is based on the record before the

tribunal.'4° Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1), it is the tribunal, and not an ICSID

annulment committee, that is the judge of the admissibility of evidence and its probative

value. '4!

It follows from these principles that a party seeking annulment cannot make new arguments
on the merits that were not made in the original proceedings, or more generally, try to re-
argue the case on the merits. Thus, for instance, in Kléckner I, the ad hoc committee noted
that an application for annulment cannot be used by a party “to complete or develop an
argument which it could and should have made during the arbitral proceeding or help that
party retrospectively to fill gaps in its arguments.” !4? Other ICSID annulment committees

have made similar observations. 3

In the present case, there appears to be no disagreement between the Parties as to the
applicable legal principles, as outlined above. These principles will govern and inform the

Committee’s determinations, as relevant, as set out in this Section V.

GROUND 1: SERIOUS BREACH OF FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE—DENIAL OF
RIGHT TO BE HEARD ON THE ILLEGALITY OBJECTION (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))

The Applicant contends that it was denied the right to be heard on the Ilegality Objection
as a result of the Tribunal’s procedural decisions excluding certain evidence from the
record. The Applicant challenges, in particular, the Tribunal’s Procedural Order Nos 7, 8
and 9, which excluded substantial parts of its legality Objection, refused the Applicant’s
request for extension of the page limit for its response and ordered the redaction of three

witness statements submitted by Zimbabwe. According to the Applicant, these decisions

constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and thus justify the

annulment of the Award in its entirety.'“+

There is no dispute between the Parties that the right to be heard is a fundamental rule of
procedure. The Committee agrees, as have agreed other ICSID ad hoc committees.'4>
However, the Parties disagree as to whether the Tribunal committed a serious breach of

this rule.

The Committee has carefully reviewed the procedural history of the arbitration proceeding
in order to determine whether the Applicant was denied an opportunity to plead its illegality
defense and to present evidence in its support, including, and in particular, as a result of

Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and 9.

The Committee notes that the Tribunal took its decisions in Procedural Order Nos 7, 8 and
9 in the context of protracted proceedings, which resulted in additional pleading rounds
beyond the initially envisaged two rounds and in several postponements of the evidentiary
hearing. As summarized above, the additional pleading rounds were ordered by the
Tribunal, in particular, in order to allow Zimbabwe to raise its legality Objection, even
though Zimbabwe had initially indicated that it did not intend to challenge the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal. Zimbabwe did not raise any jurisdictional objections in its Counter-
Memorial, and while it did raise certain jurisdictional and admissibility objections in its
Rejoinder, including on the basis that the VPBs’ investments allegedly had not been
approved as required under Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT, it did not
challenge the legality of the VPBs’ investments. Although filed late under ICSID
Arbitration Rule 41(1), the Tribunal admitted all of these objections in Procedural Order
No 3, finding that “special circumstances” existed, within the meaning of ICSID
Arbitration Rule 26(3), which justified the admission of the objections even if pleaded out

of time.

‘4 The Applicant also contends, under this annulment ground, that Mr Fortier was biased against Zimbabwe. The
Committee considers it more appropriate to address this argument when dealing with the third ground of annulment.
445 See, e.g., Fraport v Philippines (LALEX-045), para 197; Wena v Egypt (LALEX-044), para 57; MINE v Guinea
(ZALEX-043), para 5.06.

In its Rebutter dated 19 April 2013, Zimbabwe expanded its Approval Objection under
Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and also raised, for the first time, an objection
to the legality of the investments under both Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT
and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, on the basis that the VPBs had failed to
obtain approval from competent Zimbabwean authorities for their investments.'4°
Although the Tribunal had not scheduled further pleadings beyond Zimbabwe’s 19 April
2013 Rebutter, on 4 July 2013, Zimbabwe wrote a letter to the Tribunal raising a wider
illegality objection (the “Wider Iegality Objection”), arguing now that all of the VPBs’
investments were in breach of Zimbabwe’s exchange control regulations and therefore
illegal. On 8 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 7, dismissing the
VPBs’ application not to admit the legality Objection raised in the Rebutter, deciding not
to admit Zimbabwe’s 4 July 2013 letter as an additional pleading, and ordering Zimbabwe
instead to file by 16 August 2013 a Re-Rebutter setting out its legality Objection under
Article 9(b) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and Article 2 of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe
BIT.

Zimbabwe filed its Re-Rebutter on 15 August 2013, expanding the scope of its Illegality
Objection, but not arguing, at this time, that all of the VPBs’ investments were illegal for
failure to comply with Zimbabwe’s exchange control regulations. In other words, although
given the opportunity to clearly set out its legality Objection in this pleading, Zimbabwe
did not embrace in its Re-Rebutter the Wider Illegality Objection it had raised in its 4 July
2013 letter.

It was not until 26 September 2013, in its Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter, that
Zimbabwe for the first time raised its Wider Illegality Objection in an admissible pleading,
alleging that all of the VPBs’ investments were in breach of Zimbabwe’s exchange control

regulations and therefore illegal. Zimbabwe also contended that Exhibit C-858 (which the

'46 While Zimbabwe argued in the original arbitration that its illegality objection was an objection to admissibility
rather than jurisdiction, it argues now in the annulment proceeding that it was in fact an objection to jurisdiction (see,
e.g., Memorial, paras 599-606). As explained below, the Committee does not consider that this characterization issue
is of any relevance in the present proceeding; the issue is rather whether Zimbabwe was improperly precluded from
raising this objection or producing evidence in its support.

250.

VPBs had filed with their Response to the Re-Rebutter on 9 September 2013) was not
relevant since at the time the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe granted its approval for the
transaction reflected in Exhibit C-858, neither party to the transaction was owned or
controlled by the VPBs; accordingly the document could not evidence exchange control
approval of the VPB’s investments. '*” This point was subsequently conceded by the VPBs,
in a telephone conference hearing held on 11 October 2013 (see below) and in their

skeleton argument for the hearing.

After hearing the Parties by way of a telephone conference on 11 October 2013, the
Tribunal on 15 October 2013 issued Procedural Order No 9, excluding, inter alia,
Zimbabwe’s 26 September 2013 pleading insofar as it raised the new Wider Illegality
Objection that Zimbabwe had not raised in its 15 August 2013 Re-Rebutter. The Tribunal
found that “[t]his expansion of [Zimbabwe’s] jurisdictional objections was done in breach
of the Tribunal’s Procedural Orders, in particular paragraph 55(i) of PO No 3 and
paragraph 62 of PO No 7, as well as Arbitration Rules 31(3) and 41(1).”!48 The Tribunal
also found that no special circumstances existed within the meaning of ICSID Arbitration
Rule 26(3) to warrant the admission of the Wider Illegality Objection at that stage of
proceedings. '*? The Tribunal also declared inadmissible certain passages in Zimbabwe’s

witness statements, insofar as they related to the Wider Ilegality Objection.

The Committee notes that the alleged illegality of the VPBs’ investments is a preliminary
objection on which Zimbabwe had the burden of proof from the very beginning of the
arbitration. However, as noted above, Zimbabwe did not raise the Illegality Objection until
its Rebutter in April 2013, when it argued that the VPBs’ investments were illegal for lack
of approval, and in its letter of 4 July 2013, when it for the first time raised the Wider
Illegality Objection, to the effect that all of the VPBs’ investments were illegal for failure

to comply with the exchange control regulations (however, as noted above, the 4 July 2013

1992 (ZA-045 / C-858 in the original arbitration). See also Zimbabwe's Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter

letter was not an admissible pleading). It is therefore not correct to state, as the Applicant
does, that it was not in a position to raise the Wider legality Objection until the VPBs
filed Exhibit C-858 on 9 September 2013. Moreover, as summarized above, the Applicant
itself did not consider at the time that Exhibit C-858 constituted relevant evidence because
when the transaction referred to in C-858 (which showed the approval of the acquisition of
Franconian through Saxonian) occurred, the VPBs did not own Saxonian; both companies
were owned by their previous owner (Société Générale de Belgique). !°° Consequently, the
Applicant’s contention that it was not in a position to raise the Wider Illegality Objection
(i.e., that all of the VPBs’ investments were illegal for failure to comply with Zimbabwe’s
exchange control regulations) until the VPBs submitted Exhibit C-858, together with its

9 September 2013 Response, has no basis in fact.!>!

251. It is well-established that an ICSID annulment proceeding is indeed an annulment
proceeding and not an appeal, and it is therefore not a place for a party to raise an argument
that it did not make in the underlying arbitration proceeding!**—and even less a place to
raise an argument that contradicts the argument raised by a party in the arbitration
proceeding. Consequently, insofar as the Applicant seeks to argue now, in this annulment
proceeding, that Exhibit C-858 constitutes evidence of illegality, it raises a new argument
that cannot be considered at this stage of the proceedings, even assuming it were valid

(which in any event is not the case, as conceded by Zimbabwe in the arbitration).

'50 Zimbabwe’ s Reply to the Response to the Re-Rebutter dated 26 September 2013 (VPB-079), p. 9 and Third Witness
Statement of Mr Onias Claver Masiwa dated 23 September 2013 (ZA-047), paras 4-5.

'S! The Applicant also cannot argue that it could not determine whether Tanks Limited had the necessary exchange
control approvals because it was not aware that Franconian was previously called Tanks Limited, and because it only
became aware of this fact when the VPBs filed C-858 (which showed the previous name of Franconian). As pointed
out by the Respondents, one of the VPBs’ witness statements, filed in support of its Memorial, contained an
organogram showing the previous name of Franconian. The Committee does not follow the Applicant's argument that
the fact that the name of Tanks Limited was handwritten somehow precluded Zimbabwe from performing the
necessary verifications.

182 See Klockner I (ZALEX-078), para 83 (“[A]s a rule an application for annulment cannot serve as a substitute for
an appeal against an award and permit criticism of the merits of the judgments rightly or wrongly formulated by the
award. Nor can it be used by one party to complete or develop an argument which it could and should have made
during the arbitral proceeding or help that party retrospectively to fill gaps in its arguments.”). See also Postovd banka
v Greece (VPBLEX-082), para 130; MINE v Guinea (LALEX-043), para 6.42; Vieira v Chile (VPBLEX-083), para

The Applicant now also argues that Exhibit R-087 (a letter from the Merchant Bank of
Central Africa Limited to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe dated 8 September 1992), in
which the Merchant Bank states, on behalf of Tanks Consolidated Investment Limited (the
previous name of Franconian), that when Franconian is transferred to Saxonian, “there will

””153 records a condition

be no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of [Franconian],
imposed by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe that applied to any future transactions
involving Franconian. The Applicant suggests that the subsequent transfer of Franconian
to the VPBs breached this condition. This is a new argument not made by Zimbabwe in the
arbitration and therefore not relevant in this annulment proceeding; as noted above, a party
cannot raise new arguments in ICSID annulment proceedings that it could have raised, but
did not raise, in the arbitration proceeding. In any event, the Applicant misreads the letter;
the Committee agrees with the Respondents that it is evident from the language and context
of the letter that it refers to the 9 December 1992 transaction itself and does not apply to
any future transactions. Indeed, the statement is contained in a letter from Tanks
Consolidated Investment Limited to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, and not from the latter

to the former, so in any event it cannot be read to contain a condition imposed by the Bank.

The Committee is unable to find in the sequence of procedural events summarized above
any denial of opportunity for the Applicant to be able to argue its case on illegality, nor
any breach of its right to be heard. It is undisputed that Zimbabwe raised its illegality
defense, in its narrow form, only in its Rebutter on 19 April 2013. At that point in time,
Zimbabwe had already had an opportunity to raise its illegality defense twice, both in its
Counter-Memorial and in its Rejoinder. It was only in its 26 September 2013 Reply to the
Response to the Re-Rebutter that Zimbabwe sought to extend its illegality defense, which
it had finally raised in its Rebutter in April 2013, to govern all of the VPBs’ investments.
In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the Applicant was denied the opportunity to be
heard on its illegality defense. Nor does the Committee agree that the Tribunal acted
improperly when issuing Procedural Order No 9, in which it found Zimbabwe’s Wider

Tllegality Objection and the supporting witness evidence to be inadmissible. The Tribunal’s

decisions were legitimate procedural decisions to protect the due process rights of both
Parties in circumstances where one of the Parties continued to raise new preliminary
objections out of time, and where the Party in question had already been given an

opportunity to raise its new objections even if they were out of time.

The Committee further notes that, while the Applicant now argues that its legality
Objection was an objection to jurisdiction, in the arbitration it characterized its objection
as an objection to admissibility rather than jurisdiction.'°+ However, the issue of
characterization of the Applicant’s objection has no bearing on the Committee’s
determination as to whether or not there has been a serious breach of a fundamental rule of
procedure. While under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) an ICSID tribunal “may on its own
initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary
claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence,” the
burden of proof remains with the party raising a preliminary objection, whether based on
jurisdiction or admissibility. Indeed, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 (‘Preliminary
Objections”), which requires that preliminary objections “be made as early as possible”
and be filed “no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-
memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder,”
covers all preliminary objections, including those to “competence,” and not only objections
to jurisdiction. While the provision makes an exception for situations in which “the facts
on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time,” the Tribunal did
allow Zimbabwe to raise its Ilegality Objection late, after the completion of the first two
rounds of pleadings. Moreover, and in any event, Exhibit C-858 (which the Applicant
argues constituted new evidence relevant to illegality) cannot be considered to evidence a
new fact which was unknown to Zimbabwe at the time; as noted above, both Parties agreed
in the arbitration that it was not relevant evidence as it did not relate to a transaction entered

into by the VPBs.155

154 See Award (VPB-174), paras 344, 346.
'55 Tt is also evident from the record that, based on the information in Appendix | filed with VPBs’ Memorial,
Zimbabwe would have been able to verify whether the required exchange control regulations, if any, had been
provided to all of the VPBs’ investments.

59

259.

An ICSID tribunal’s task is to provide a party with a reasonable opportunity to be heard;
there is no right to an unlimited opportunity to be heard. It is for the party concerned to
take advantage of that opportunity, when provided. In the present case, the Tribunal did
provide the Applicant with a reasonable opportunity, and indeed several opportunities, to
be heard on its [legality Objection, and accordingly there was no denial of the right to be
heard and therefore no breach of a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of

Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.

Finally, as to Zimbabwe’ s argument that the Tribunal denied Zimbabwe’s right to be heard,
thus committing a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure, when dismissing in
Procedural Order No 8 Zimbabwe’s request for a page extension of its 26 September 2013
pleading by three to four pages, the Committee is unable to see in such a routine procedural
decision any denial of the right to be heard, in particular as the new matters raised by the
VPBs in their 9 September 2013 submission were responsive to Zimbabwe’s Re-Rebutter

and accordingly the page extension was not justified in the first place.

The Applicant’s first ground of annulment is therefore dismissed.

GROUND 2: SERIOUS BREACH OF FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE—DENIAL OF
RIGHT TO BE HEARD AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF THE PRESIDENT’S DISCLOSURE
(ARTICLE 52(1)(D))

The Applicant argues that Mr Yves Fortier, the President of the Tribunal, failed to timely
disclose his role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board, which he had held
since May 2012. Mr Fortier mentioned his position during the hearing, on 31 October 2013,
when inquiring whether either Party would have any issue if the Secretary of the Sanctions
Board were to attend the hearing on that day. According to the Applicant, it was too late at
that point in time, when the proceedings had already reached the hearing stage, to seek
disqualification. As result, the late disclosure deprived the Applicant of the right to be heard
in the matter, which allegedly constitutes a serious breach of a fundamental rule of

procedure.

The Respondents note that the World Bank Sanctions Board has no power to pronounce

sanctions against States and accordingly its sanctioning powers are irrelevant in this

60

260.

261.

proceeding. According to the Respondents, Mr Fortier is not an official of the World Bank
and when chairing the Sanctions Board—he acts independently, just as he acted
independently when chairing the Tribunal. Consequently, Mr Fortier’s function as a
chairperson of the Sanctions Board was not a disclosable matter, and even if it had been,
Zimbabwe had ample time to challenge him—until 3 February 2015, when the Tribunal
declared the proceedings closed. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, the
Applicant has therefore waived its right to challenge Mr Fortier’s alleged lack of

impartiality.

The Committee need not, in this annulment proceeding, take a view on whether
Mr Fortier’s position as a chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board constitutes a
valid basis for disqualification, or whether any disqualification application by Zimbabwe
would have been successful. The Committee merely notes, as the issue has been debated
by the Parties in this annulment proceeding, that the Sanctions Board is tasked with
sanctioning companies and individuals suspected of having engaged in misconduct and
recommending sanctions to the World Bank President, to protect the integrity of World
Bank’s operations and to ensure that development financing is used only for its intended
purpose. The Sanctions Board has no jurisdiction to impose sanctions on States, and it is
undisputed that the Sanctions Board has not imposed sanctions in connection with any
World Bank operations involving Zimbabwe. The Applicant’s case appears rather to be
that any position involving sanctioning powers or authority to impose sanctions of any kind
is incompatible with the function of the president of an ICSID tribunal in the present case,
given that Zimbabwe has been a target of international sanctions since the early 2000s.'*°
This is a broad proposition, and certainly not one that Zimbabwe has demonstrated would
create a prima facie basis for disqualification. Be that as it may, Zimbabwe never made
any application to disqualify Mr Fortier, so the proposition that Zimbabwe now advances

was never assessed as part of the arbitration proceeding.

As to the Applicant’s argument that Mr Fortier’s late disclosure deprived it of the

opportunity to challenge him, the Committee notes that under ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1)

86 See Tr Day 1, 64:24-69:24.

61

262.

263.

264.

“Ta] party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the
Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file
its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.”!*” In the present case,
as the Applicant became aware of the alleged basis for disqualification during the hearing,
it could have brought an application for disqualification at any time between the end of the
hearing, which occurred on 2 November 2013, and 3 February 2015, the date when the
Tribunal declared the proceedings closed. The Committee is unable to agree that a proposal
for disqualification at that stage of the proceedings would have been futile as the Tribunal

had not yet rendered its award.

Consequently, in view of its failure to propose disqualification promptly, as soon as it
became aware of the alleged basis of disqualification, the Applicant must be considered to
have waived its right to challenge Mr Fortier, in accordance with Rule 27 of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules. According to Rule 27, a party which knows that a provision of the Rules
has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections, “shall be
deemed ... to have waived its right to object.” '** Accordingly, it cannot be said that the
Applicant was deprived of the opportunity to challenge the President of the Tribunal and

that, as a result, it was denied the right to be heard.
The Applicant’s second ground of annulment therefore stands to be dismissed.

GROUND 3: TRIBUNAL NOT PROPERLY CONSTITUTED—LACK OF IMPARTIALITY OF
PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNAL (ARTICLE 52(1)(A))

The Applicant’s third ground of annulment is based on the same alleged facts as the second
ground—Mr Fortier’s involvement with the World Bank Sanctions Board, which
according to the Applicant was incompatible with his function as President of the Tribunal.
According to the Applicant, Mr Fortier not only was perceived as being partial as a result

of his function; he also acted de facto in a partial manner, in particular during the hearing.

157 According to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, a party may propose disqualification of a member of an ICSID
tribunal “on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.”
According to Article 14(1), one of the qualities required is that the person in question “may be relied upon to exercise
independent judgment.”

158 The provision is subject to Article 45 of the ICSID Convention (“Failure to Appear”), which however does not
apply in the present case.

62

265.

266.

267.

According to the Applicant, this calls for annulment of the Award on the basis that the

Tribunal was not properly constituted under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention.

The Respondents argue that Zimbabwe could have invoked Article 57 of the Convention
and accordingly could have proposed the disqualification of Mr Fortier at any time after
the date when it became aware of the alleged manifest lack of impartiality, until the closure
of the proceedings on 3 February 2015; however, it failed to do so. Having thus failed to
comply with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1), which requires a party to raise its proposal for
disqualification “promptly,” the Applicant must be deemed to have waived its right to

challenge, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.

The Committee agrees that ICSID Arbitration Rules 9(1) and 27 are indeed the relevant
provisions in this context. Consequently, insofar as the Applicant relies in support of its
application on the mere fact of Mr Fortier’s function as chairperson of the Sanctions Board
(said to be incompatible with his function as President of the Tribunal), the annulment
application stands to be dismissed on the same basis as the Applicant’s second ground of
annulment—the Applicant must be considered to have waived its right to seek

disqualification under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.

The Committee also fails to see in Mr Fortier’s conduct during the arbitration proceedings,
including the hearing, any evidence of lack of impartiality. First, to the extent that the
Applicant relies on the decisions taken by the Tribunal which dismissed Zimbabwe’s
position in the arbitration or were otherwise incompatible with its pleaded position, as
evidence of alleged lack of impartiality, such decisions, without more, are insufficient to
establish the Applicant’s case. Indeed, it is the very function of an ICSID tribunal to resolve
disputes, that is, to decide which party is right and which party is wrong on any disputed
issue, and such decisions, which are a necessary element of the dispute resolution function,
cannot, without more, constitute evidence of partiality. Second, all the decisions taken by
the Tribunal, including those referred to by the Applicant, were unanimous; in the one
instance where Mr Fortier acted alone, this was because the matter was urgent, and the

Parties had previously agreed that in such a situation the President was indeed authorized

63

268.

269.

270.

271.

272.

to act without consulting his co-Arbitrators.'°? Moreover, that decision was not disputed

by Zimbabwe at the time.

Nor is the Committee able to find evidence of partiality in the President’s conduct during
the hearing; indeed, the Applicant confirmed at the end of the hearing that it had had its

day in court and had been treated fairly.'°
In view of the above, the Applicant’s third ground of annulment is to be dismissed.

GROUND 4; SERIOUS BREACH OF FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE—DENIAL OF
RIGHT TO BE HEARD AS A RESULT OF FAILURE TO DISCLOSE (ARTICLE 52(1)(D))

The Applicant’s fourth ground of annulment is based essentially on the same issue as its
second and third grounds of annulment—Mr Fortier’s role as chairperson of the World
Bank Sanctions Board. While both the second and the fourth ground rely on the same legal
argument—alleged serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure—they differ as to
their factual basis: the second ground focuses on the (informal and late) manner in which
the disclosure was made, whereas the fourth ground relies on the alleged failure to disclose.
On the other hand, the third and the fourth ground of annulment are based on the same
facts, but their legal basis is different—the third ground relies on the alleged improper
constitution of the Tribunal, whereas the fourth ground is founded on an alleged serious

breach of a fundamental rule of procedure.

Under its fourth ground of annulment, the Applicant argues that Mr Fortier withheld
information about his role as chairperson of the World Bank Sanctions Board for 548 days
after his appointment and did not disclose it until two days before the end of the hearing.
According to the Applicant, this constitutes a failure to disclose, which amounts to a serious

breach of a fundamental rule of procedure. The Award therefore must be annulled.

The Respondents argue that there was nothing significant to be disclosed, and that in any
event, a duty to disclose is not a fundamental rule of procedure. Moreover, Zimbabwe

waived its right to challenge the Award on this basis as it failed to challenge Mr Fortier

during the arbitration. According to the Respondents, even assuming the duty to disclose
constituted a fundamental rule of procedure, which the Respondents deny, there was no
serious breach of the rule since in the absence of any evidence of lack of impartiality, the

failure to disclose had no impact on the outcome of the proceedings.

The Committee notes that, even assuming Mr Fortier had an obligation to disclose (an issue
on which the Committee need not take a view, in view of its finding below), Mr Fortier did
in fact disclose his function as chairperson of the Sanctions Board during the arbitration.
As determined in Section C) above, in connection with the Applicant’s second ground of
annulment, the Applicant was in fact not deprived of an opportunity to be heard, as it still
had ample time to propose disqualification during the period from Mr Fortier’s statement
at the hearing until the closure of the proceedings, which occurred more than a year later.

The Applicant had an opportunity to be heard, but it did not use that opportunity.

Accordingly, the Applicant was not denied the right to be heard and its fourth ground of

annulment must be dismissed.

GROUND 5: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS—FAILURE TO APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAW
TO THE NECESSITY DEFENSE (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))

The Applicant contends that the Tribunal applied customary international law and
Zimbabwean law when deciding on the Applicant’s necessity defense and thus failed to
apply the relevant provisions of the BITs—Ad Article 3(a) of the Protocol to the Germany-
Zimbabwe BIT and Article 7(1) and 7(2)(b) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT. The
Tribunal thus failed to apply the applicable law and thus exceeded its powers within the
meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

According to the Applicant, its application is timely as it only learned about the Tribunal’s

failure to apply the proper law when reviewing the Award.

The Respondents submit that the Tribunal did apply the applicable international law when
determining Zimbabwe’s necessity defense and made clear that they did not apply

Zimbabwean law. The Respondents further note that Ad Article 3(a) of the Protocol to the

65

278.

279.

280.

Germany-Zimbabwe BIT does not deal with necessity, and Zimbabwe never invoked

Article 7(2) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT before the annulment proceedings.

The Committee notes that Zimbabwe raised its necessity defense in the arbitration
proceedings primarily in terms of Article 25 of the ILC Articles, and that the Tribunal
devoted a significant part of the Award to this issue.'°! Having analyzed the issue
extensively, the Tribunal eventually dismissed the defense, concluding that Zimbabwe had
not satisfied the requirements of Article 25. Consequently, the Tribunal did apply
international law rather than Zimbabwean law when determining Zimbabwe’s necessity
defense. As noted above, the Tribunal also specifically addressed Zimbabwe’s defense
based on Ad Article 3(a) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT, dismissing it.'°? While the
Tribunal did not specifically address Article 7(1) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT, this
provision only provides for national treatment and MEN treatment in relation to restitution,
indemnification, compensation or other settlement of claims in the context of “war, other
armed conflict, revolution, a state of emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot,” and
accordingly does not contain any general necessity defense. Moreover, as noted by the
Respondents, Zimbabwe never specifically invoked Article 7(2) of the Switzerland-
Zimbabwe BIT in the arbitration,'® and in any event, Article 7(2) also does not provide
for a necessity defense; it merely refers to necessity as an exception to the obligation to
restitute or compensate for destruction of property in the circumstances referred to in

Article 7(1).

Consequently, the Tribunal did not fail to apply the applicable law and the Applicant’s fifth
ground of annulment fails.
GROUND 6: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS—FAILURE TO APPLY THE APPLICABLE LAW

TO THE ILLEGALITY DEFENSE (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))

The Applicant’s sixth ground of annulment is based on the argument that the Tribunal

failed to apply the applicable Zimbabwean law, specifically Zimbabwe’s exchange control

regulations, when determining the legality of the VPBs’ investments. The Applicant’s
argument relies on the premise that the Tribunal improperly excluded the Applicant’s

Wider Illegality Argument and the supporting evidence.

The Committee has rejected the Applicant’s Wider Ilegality Argument (above in
Section B), when addressing the Applicant’s first ground annulment, and it follows that the
Applicant’s sixth ground of annulment also fails. The Applicant never raised the Wider
Illegality Argument in an admissible pleading and therefore cannot rely on it as a basis for
an annulment application to argue that the Tribunal failed to apply the law applicable to its

illegality argument.

The Applicant’s sixth ground of annulment is accordingly dismissed.

GROUND 7: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS—NO JURISDICTION AS THE RESPONDENTS’
INVESTMENTS WERE ILLEGAL (ARTICLE 52(1)(B))

The Applicant contends that the Tribunal wrongly characterized its illegality defense as an
objection to admissibility rather than jurisdiction and therefore manifestly exceeded its
powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. According to the
Applicant, jurisdiction is dominant over admissibility as it relates to the State’s consent to

arbitrate and also cannot be created by way of estoppel.

The Committee notes that, in the arbitration, Zimbabwe raised its objections regarding the
legality of the VPBs’ investments and their approval as objections to admissibility rather
than jurisdiction (while noting that jurisdiction and admissibility are often considered
together). The Tribunal determined to treat Zimbabwe’s illegality objections as objections
to admissibility, “consistent with how they have been presented by [Zimbabwe] in the

o 164

majority of its pleadings, adding that “the characterization of these arguments as either

jurisdictional or relating to admissibility, in these cases, is immaterial.” !©

As the Committee noted above, a party seeking annulment of an ICSID award cannot raise
new arguments in an annulment proceeding that it did not raise in the underlying arbitration
proceedings. As stressed by the ad hoc Committee in Kléckner I, an application for
annulment cannot be used “to complete or develop an argument which it could and should
have made during the arbitral proceeding or help that party retrospectively to fill gaps in

its arguments.” !°°

In any event, even assuming that the Tribunal should have characterized Zimbabwe’s
objection (contrary to its pleading) as an objection to jurisdiction rather than admissibility,
the Applicant has failed to show or indeed even argue that this would have resulted in a
different outcome, or that the alleged excess of jurisdiction was manifest, as required by

Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

The Applicant’s seventh annulment ground is accordingly dismissed.

GROUND 8: FAILURE TO STATE REASONS—THE APPLICANT’S ILLEGALITY ARGUMENT
WAS NOT CONSIDERED (ARTICLE 52(1)(E))

The Applicant’s eighth ground of annulment is based on Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID
Convention, which provides for annulment if “the award has failed to state the reasons on

which it is based.”

As noted above, the Respondents argue that, insofar as the Applicant relies on
Article 52(1)(e), its Annulment Application is time-barred and as such inadmissible as it
did not mention Article 52(1)(e) at all in its Annulment Application dated 21 October 2015.
This particular ground for annulment was introduced by the Applicant only on 7 June 2017,
when it filed its Amended and Restated Annulment Application, together with its Memorial
on Annulment. According to the Respondents, this conclusion is not affected by the fact
that the original Annulment Application did mention the matters that the Applicant now
raises in support of its eighth annulment ground, as these matters were raised only in

support of other annulment grounds.

The Applicant argues, in response, that the Respondents’ position is “formalistic” and
refers, in support, to the Amco I decision, in which the ad hoc committee considered
whether the application for annulment should contain more than just a reference to the
grounds in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and went on to examine whether the
annulment grounds in question could be reasonably be considered as being covered by the
statements in the annulment application. According to the Applicant, “the elements of
Ground 8 could reasonably be considered as covered by the statements in the [A]pplication
for [A]nnulment” as they “were in fact referred to in the Application or reasonably implicit
in the Application.”!©’ The Applicant also refers to the Wena v Egypt and Kléckner II
annulment decisions, which, according to the Applicant, adopted a similar approach. The
Applicant suggests that “there is no harm to VPB as it had the issues if not yet [in] the final
form and as it has not needed not [sic] respond to [the Annulment Application] before its

[Counter-Memorial].”!*

The Committee recalls that under Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention, annulment may
be requested on one or more of the grounds set out in Article 52(1), and that the application
shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered (with the
exception of the ground of corruption, which is not relevant in this case). Furthermore,
under ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)(iii), an application for annulment must “state in
detail ... the grounds on which it is based.” The issue in the present case is whether the
applicant can omit mentioning the specific annulment ground that it invokes, and whether
it is sufficient to simply mention the specific reasons, or substantive grounds, for
annulment, albeit under a different legal annulment ground, without invoking the

annulment ground itself.

The Committee notes that in all of the three other cases cited by the Applicant in support
of its position—Amco I, Kléckner II and Wena v Egypt—the issue was whether it is
sufficient to merely refer to the legal annulment ground in Article 52(1) of the ICSID
Convention, or whether the applicant should also “detail” the reasons, or the substantive

grounds on which its application is based and, if so, on what level of “detail.” The issue in

‘61 Reply, para 917.

'68 Reply, para 921.

69

the three cases was therefore the opposite to the one in the present case, where the
Applicant suggests that it only needs to set out the reasons but need not mention the legal

annulment ground itself.

293. Thus, in Amco I, the ad hoc committee characterized the issue before it in the following

terms:

It appears to the ad hoc Committee that Arbitration Rule 50(i)(c) is
not adequately complied with by an Application for annulment
which merely recites verbatim the specific subparagraph(s) of
Article 52(1) of the Convention being invoked by the applicant. The
thrust of Arbitration Rule 50 is not successfully avoided by coupling
a recital of the subparagraphs invoked with a general reservation
of a “right to supplement (a) presentation [of Indonesia’s claims]
with further written submissions.” !©

294. Similarly, in Kléckner II, the ad hoc committee addressed Kléckner’s argument that
Cameroon’s annulment application was inadmissible because it did “not state any reason
which could justify the annulment on the basis of any of these three grounds [invoked by
Cameroon in its application].”!”° The ad hoc committee noted that “[t]he Washington
Convention, in Article 52 and other provisions, does not require an application for
annulment to be reasoned ‘in detail,’”!”! and concluded that “it is incumbent upon the
Committee, seized with an annulment application, to determine whether the claims
submitted by the applicant can be considered as included within or covered by the grounds

on which the application is founded.” !”?

Case No ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment, 16 May 1986 (“Amco I”), available in: 1 ICSID Reports 509 (1993)
(ZALEX-214), para 46. The ad hoc committee went on to find that the grounds invoked by Amco “are not really new
grounds raised for the first time by Indonesia in its Memorial but were either in fact referred to in the Application or
reasonably implicit in the Application” (Amco I (ZALEX-214), para 53).

In Wena v Egypt, the respondent (Wena) argued that “several grounds for annulment were
time-barred, by the fact that they had not been argued in the initial Request, but only later
in the Applicant’s Memorial requesting annulment.”!”? Noting that Wena had “admitted
[...] that these arguments do not exceed the scope of the grounds for annulment initially
invoked,” the ad hoc committee concluded that “[t]he ICSID Convention [...] does not
preclude raising new arguments which are related to a ground of annulment invoked within

the time limit fixed in the Convention.”!”*

In the circumstances of this case, the Committee need not take a view on how detailed the
reasons, or the substantive grounds, for the application should be as this is not the issue
before it. The Applicant has failed on the threshold issue of having failed to refer to Article

52(1)(e) in support of its Application in the first place.

The Committee concludes that the Applicant’s eighth ground for annulment is time-barred

and as such inadmissible.

COSTS

THE APPLICANT’S COST SUBMISSION

The Applicant submits that ICSID administrative costs should be borne equally by the
Parties, regardless of the outcome of the two annulment phases. As to the Parties’ legal

fees and costs, the Applicant argues that each Party should bear its own costs. !7>

The Applicant states that its position is consistent with Article 10(6) of the Germany-
Zimbabwe BIT!” and Article 11(6) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT!” which should be
considered by the Committees as representing the Parties’ agreement on these issues within

the meaning of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. !78

The Applicant states that it has made advance payments to ICSID in the total amount of
US$ 900,000 (US$ 450,000 for each case), and that it has incurred € 986,687.50 in legal
fees and € 36,191.17 in disbursements to its legal counsel, as well as expenses in the
amount of US$ 208,100 in connection with the travel of Zimbabwe’s delegation to Paris,

France, for work sessions with counsel and to attend the two hearings. 19

According to the Applicant, an analysis of the Parties’ procedural conduct during both the
arbitration and the annulment proceedings supports its submission that each Party be held
liable for half of the ICSID administrative fees and for the full amount of its own legal fees
and costs. In particular, the Applicant insists that both Parties contributed to delays in the
arbitration,'®° and the VPBs withheld evidence, in particular Exhibit C-858, which
increased the inefficiency of the proceedings.'*! The Applicant has also “acted in an
efficient, professional and courteous manner throughout the pendency of the annulment

proceeding.” !®?

Finally, and in any event, the Applicant argues that ICSID tribunals most often decide in

favor of each party bearing its own costs.'*? In addition, the Applicant highlights that the

"76 Article 10(6) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT reads, in part: “Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own
member and of its representatives at the arbitration proceedings. The cost of the chair[person] and the remaining costs
shall be borne in equal parts by the Contracting Parties. The arbitral tribunal may make a different decision concerning
costs. In all other respect, the arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure” (VPBLEX-021).

177 Article 11(6) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT reads: “Each Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the
tribunal and of its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chair[person] and the remaining costs
shall be borne in equal parts by the Parties” (VPBLEX-023).

Respondents’ legal fees total more than twice those claimed by the Applicant and are

THE RESPONDENTS’ COST SUBMISSION

The Respondents disagree with the Applicant’s position that both applicable BITs contain
provisions dealing with the apportionment of arbitration costs and legal fees. Indeed, the
provisions referred to by the Applicant (Article 10(6) of the Germany-Zimbabwe BIT and
Article 11(6) of the Switzerland-Zimbabwe BIT) only apply in State-to-State arbitration,
and thus should be ignored by the Committee.'®* According to the Respondents, the
provisions which do address investor-State arbitration in the BITs are silent on the

apportionment of arbitration costs and legal fees. !*°

The Respondents argue that the Committees should apply the “costs follow the event”
principle. The Respondents contend that, should the Committees fully reject the
Applicant’s annulment application, in accordance with the practice of ICSID annulment
committees, the Applicant should also be ordered to bear all of the ICSID administrative

costs (according to the current trend in annulment decisions).!°”

As to legal costs (i.e., the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with annulment
proceedings, including legal fees), the Respondents note that two apportionment
approaches have been generally followed by ICSID annulment committees: (i) the “costs
follow the event” approach; '** and (ii) each party bears its own costs, unless the annulment
application fundamentally lacks merit or a different allocation is warranted in light of the
parties’ conduct.'*° The Respondents submit that, while in their view the former approach

is preferable, in this case both approaches should lead the Committee to shift (if not fully

at least in part)'®° the burden of the Respondents’ costs on to the Applicant, notably because
the Applicant’s application was fundamentally lacking in merit, and because of its conduct
in the course of the annulment proceeding, in particular its failure to establish an escrow
account for payment of the Award and the manner and tone of presentation in its

pleadings. '?!

While the Respondents dispute that they were responsible for any of the delay in the
arbitration proceedings, they point out that the conduct of the Parties in the arbitration
proceeding is irrelevant to the determination of costs in this annulment proceeding. '°? The
Respondents also deny that they were responsible for any inefficiency of the arbitration
proceedings and reiterate that they did not withhold Exhibit C-858, which in any event was

irrelevant to the arbitration proceeding, as agreed by both Parties at the time.

The Respondents request that the Committee order the Applicant to reimburse all of their
legal costs which amount to £ 2.55 million (consisting of a fixed fee of £ 450,000 plus a
success fee of £ 2.1 million in respect of Steptoe’s fees) plus US$ 240,000 (consisting of a
fixed fee of US$ 60,000 plus a success fee of US$ 180,000) in respect of Mr Verrill’s
fees.!°? Likewise, the Respondents request that the Committee order the Applicant to pay
their disbursements, which they assess as amounting to £ 22,756.81, US$ 25,945.58 and
€ 2,150.'°4 The Respondents’ total legal fees (including success fees) and disbursements

amount to £ 2,572,765.81, US$ 265,945.58 and € 2,150.

The Respondents state that the von Pezold Claimants have borne the legal costs associated
with these annulment proceedings and accordingly the Respondents have apportioned their
costs and fees between the two annulment proceedings such that the von Pezold Claimants

seek an order in ICSID Case No ARB/10/15 for the entirety of their costs and fees and the

phase, the Applicant’s conduct should lead the Committee to order the Applicant to bear all of the arbitration costs,
“to pay at least 50% of the [Respondents’] legal costs, and to bear its own legal costs.”

THE COMMITTEE’S DECISION ON CosTS

According to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Chapter VI of the Convention, titled

the “Cost of the Proceeding,” “shall apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings before the

Committee.” In this connection, the relevant provision of Chapter VI is Article 61(2),

which provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 53 further provides that the provisions of the Rules “shall apply

mutatis mutandis to any procedure relating to [...] annulment of an award and to the

decision of the [...] Committee.” Rule 47 further specifies that “the [decision of a
Committee] shall be in writing and shall contain [...] any decision of the [Committee]

regarding the cost of the proceeding.”

In accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), the Applicant
made the advance payments requested by the ICSID Secretariat to cover the costs of the
annulment proceedings, which include the costs and expenses of the Centre and the fees
and expenses of the members of the Committee. These costs (the “Costs of the

Proceeding”) amount to US$ 359,711.12 and are broken down as follows:

Committee’s fees and expenses:

ICSID’s administrative fees US$ 106,000.00
Other disbursements”! USS 45,169.45
Total US$ 359,711.12

The Costs of the Proceeding have been paid out of the advances made by the Applicant

pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).?

The Applicant’s Annulment Application has been dismissed in its entirety. In the
circumstances, the Committee considers that it is appropriate that the costs follow the event
as to the Costs of the Proceeding as well as the Respondents’ legal costs, although not in
their entirety as to the latter, in view of the relatively large discrepancy between the costs
incurred by the Parties. In the absence of any risk of double compensation for the costs
claims of the von Pezold Claimants and the Border Claimants, the Committee accepts the
apportionment of costs as agreed between the von Pezold Claimants and the Border
Claimants. Accordingly, the Committee decides, in the exercise of its discretion under

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, that the Applicant shall bear the Costs of the

decision, reimburse 50% of the Respondents’ legal costs in the amount of £ 1,286,382.90,
US$ 132,972.79 and € 1,075.

The Committee also finds it appropriate that, if no payment is made within the stipulated
sixty-day period, the Applicant be ordered to pay interest on the outstanding amount at the
rate provided in paragraph 1024 of the Award, i.e., US$ LIBOR rate plus 2% compounded
every six months, from the sixtieth day of the date of this Decision until the date of full

payment.

DECISION
For the reasons set out above, the Committee unanimously decides as follows:

qd) The Application for Annulment of the Award of 28 July 2015 is dismissed in its

entirety;

(2) The Committee’s directions in Procedural Order No 3 regarding the appointment
of the escrow agent and the operation of the escrow accounts lapse upon the

issuance of this Decision;

(3) The Applicant shall bear in full the costs incurred by ICSID in these annulment
proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of the ad hoc

Committee, in the amount of US$ 359,711.12;

(4) The Applicant shall reimburse the Respondents for 50% of their legal costs and
expenses, in the amount of £ 1,286,382.90, US$ 132,972.79 and € 1,075, within

sixty days of the date of dispatch of this Decision; and

(5) Tf no full payment is made in accordance with sub-paragraph (4) above within the
sixty-day period, the amount payable is to be increased by interest on the
outstanding amount until full payment at the rate provided in paragraph 1024 of the

Award.
