SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FACTS

The following summary is meant to give a general overview of the present dispute. It
does not claim to include all factual aspects which will later turn out to be of relevance,
particularly as they emerged from the extensive testimony of witnesses and experts at
the hearing. The latter will be discussed, as far as relevant, in the context of the
Tribunal’s analysis of the disputed issues.

The M1 Motorway Project

The National Highway Authority (“NHA”) is a public corporation established by the
Pakistani Act No XI (National Highway Authority Act) of 1991 to assume responsibility
for the planning, development, operation and maintenance of Pakistan’s national
highways and strategic roads. Although controlled by the Government of Pakistan,
NHA is a body corporate under Pakistani law with the right to sue and to be sued in its
own name (Section 3(2) National Highway Authority Act 1991).

Among other projects, NHA planned the construction of a six-lane motorway and
ancillary works known as the “Pakistan Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway” (the “M-1
Project”).

In 1993, NHA and Bayindir entered into an agreement for the execution of the M-1
Project (the “1993 Contract”) (Exh. [Pak.] C-1). The 1993 Contract was a two page

document incorporating, inter alia, Addenda No.1-9 (Exh. [Pak.] C-1), the Conditions of
Contract - Part | and Il (Exh. [Pak.] C-4), General Specifications, Special Provisions
and Addenda to General Specifications, Drawings, Priced Bill of Quantities (BOQ), as
well as the Bid and Appendices “A to M.” In particular, it bears noting that Part |
incorporated the FIDIC General Conditions of Contract for Works of Civil Engineering
Construction (1987 edition), and Part Il, entitled “Conditions of Particular Applications,”
incorporated the amendments and supplements to Part | negotiated by the parties.

Disputes arose under the 1993 Contract, which NHA and Bayindir resolved in 1997.
As part of this resolution, the parties executed a Memorandum of Agreement on 29
March 1997 “with the objective of reviving the Contract Agreement dated 18 March
1993” (Exh. [Pak.] C-5). Under Clause 8 of the Memorandum of Agreement, the
parties agreed “to apply to the arbitration tribunal in the appropriate manner to seek the
decision of the tribunal on only the issue of the quantum of expenses incurred by

Bayindir as specified in Bayindir's claim for expenses only.’

On 3 July 1997, the parties entered into a new contract, the “Agreement for the Revival
of Contract Agreement for the Construction of Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway” (the
“1997 Contract”) (Exh. [Pak.] C-6). The 1997 Contract incorporated the 1993 Contract
“in its entirety” with some “overriding conditions” agreed in the Memorandum of
Agreement signed on 29 March 1997.

For the sake of simplicity, the Tribunal will use the terminology “clause” or "sub-clause"
of the Contract to mean the relevant clause of the (FIDIC) General Conditions of
Contract (Conditions of Contract — Part! incorporated in the 1993 agreement),
supplemented by the Conditions of Particular Applications (Conditions of Contract —
Part Il incorporated in the 1993 agreement), as revived and amended by the 1997
Contract. The Tribunal will refer to the (revived) contractual relationship as the
“Contract.”

The Contract contains a choice of the laws of Pakistan as the governing law.

By an arbitral award of 30 June 1999, Bayindir was ordered to pay USD 12,909,935 to NHA but
was declared entitled to retain USD 10,721,595 of the advance payment made under the Contract

in 1993 (Exh. [Pak.] L-27).

It was a term of the Contract that NHA would pay to Bayindir 30% of the Contract price
as an advance payment (the “Mobilisation Advance”). Accordingly, NHA paid to
Bayindir, as Mobilisation Advance, two separate amounts of USD 96,645,563.50 and
PKR 2,523,009,751.70 respectively (RP, 22: Mem. J., 1 2.16).

It was a further term of the Contract that Bayindir would provide a bank guarantee
equivalent to the amount of the Mobilisation Advance. On 9 January 1998, a
consortium of Turkish banks (comprising Tiirkiye is Bankasi A.S., Turkiye Vakiflar
Bankasi T.A.O., Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S., Finansbank A.S., Denizbankthe A.S. and
Kentbank A.S., which subrogated its rights to Bayindirbank A.S.) issued two
guarantees on behalf of Bayindir to secure the Mobilisation Advance in accordance
with the Contract (the “Mobilisation Advance Guarantees”). Consistent with the
Contract, the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees were payable to NHA “on his first
demand without whatsoever right of objection on [the Bank’s] part and without his first
claim[ing] to the Contractor.” The amounts of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees
were to decrease, as interim payments were made for work in progress.”

The performance of the Contract was to be supervised by an Engineer. Under the
Contract, the Engineer was to be appointed by the Employer (Part | — General
Conditions — sub-clause 1.1(iv)) and to obtain the Employer's approval before
exercising his authority whenever the terms of his appointment so provided (Part | —
General Conditions — sub-clause 2.1(b)). The Engineer was, for instance, required to
obtain the prior written approval of the Employer before deciding on a request for an
extension of time by the Contractor under clause 44 of the Contract (Part Il —
Conditions of Particular Applications — sub-clause 2.1(e)).

By contrast, in those cases where the Contract required the Engineer to exercise his
discretion, he was to do so "impartially within the terms of the Contract and having

The terms of the reimbursement were later modified. In June 1999, this mechanism was
replaced with a rollover system; if the amount of a given month's Mobilisation Advance
deduction exceeded the amount due to Bayindir under a particular Interim Payment Certificate
(IPC), the difference due to Pakistan would be carried forward and deducted from the next IPC.
Second, in Addendum No. 9, the fixed Mobilisation Advance repayment schedule was replaced
by a percentage deduction from each IPC, as a result of which the Mobilisation Advance
deduction would always be a percentage of Bayindir's IPC payment, and could never exceed
the IPC payment due to Bayindir.

regard to all the circumstances" (Part | — General Conditions — sub-clause 2(6)). The
issuance of the notices contemplated in sub-clauses 46.1 and 63.1(b)(ii) are examples
of cases in which the Engineer was to exercise his discretion and did not need the
Employer's prior approval. According to sub-clause 46.1, the Engineer was to notify
the Contractor if "in the opinion of the Engineer" the rate of progress of the works in
any section was too slow to comply with the agreed time for completion, for any reason
other than one which would entitle the Contractor to an extension of time. Similarly, if
in the Engineer's opinion the Contractor had failed to proceed with the works without a
reasonable excuse, the Engineer was to issue a certificate under sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii).

The Engineer was entitled to appoint a representative, the "Engineer's Representative,"
who was to carry out the duties and exercise the authority delegated to him (Part | —
General Conditions — sub-clause 2.2).

The Contract also set forth a multi-tier mechanism for the settlement of disputes,
providing first for an Engineer's decision and then for arbitration as follows:

e Any matter in dispute must first be referred in writing to the Engineer (67.1(1) of the
Contract);

« A party dissatisfied with the ensuing decision of the Engineer “may give notice to
the other party of his intention to commence arbitration” (67.1(3) of the Contract);

e The parties must then attempt to settle the dispute amicably and, unless they agree
otherwise, cannot commence arbitration at the earliest 56 days after the notice of

3 «

intention to commence arbitration;

e The dispute will then be resolved by arbitration "under the rules and provisions of
the Arbitration Act [of Pakistan] 1940 as amended or any statutory modification or
re-enactment thereof for the time being in force.”

Other relevant provisions of the Contract will be referred to later in the context of the
consideration of the disputed issues.

The origin of the present dispute

On 3 June 1998, the Engineer issued the order to commence construction; the original
completion date foreseen was 31 July 2000.‘

The same applies “if the Engineer fails to give notice of his decision on or before the eighty-
fourth day after the day on which he received the reference.”

Between September 1999 and 20 April 2001, Bayindir submitted several claims for
payment and four claims for extension of time (EOT) invoking different omissions on
the part of Pakistan (in particular delays in handing over the possession of the land’).
The first two EOT claims (EOT 01 and EOT 02) were settled by agreement during a
meeting held on 18 February 2000. This agreement’ led to the execution of Addendum
No. 9 of 17 April 2000, which set out, among other things, that “the revised Contract
Completion Date shall be 31% December 2002” and that “NHA will hand over the
remaining land as expeditiously as possible but not later than 4 months from the
signing” of Addendum No. 9. The detailed schedule attached to Addendum No. 9
provided that two priority sections had to be completed before 23 March 2001 (the
Priority Sections).

It is disputed whether, after the revival of the Contract, the performance of Bayindir was
satisfactory or not. However, Bayindir has not seriously disputed that before the
conclusion of Addendum No. 9 in April 2000, it had almost stopped work on the site.
Moreover, as will be discussed later, the evidence on the record shows that even after
the conclusion of Addendum No. 9, serious concerns remained over the pace of the
work and the quality of the equipment that Bayindir used on the site.

On 2 December 2000, the Engineer's Representative, Mr. Raymond Bridger, issued a
notice pursuant to sub-clause 46.1 of the Contract advising Bayindir that "the rate of
progress of the works is currently too slow to comply with the Time for Completion of
the Contract" and asking it to "submit details as to the actions that [it] propose[s], in
order to comply with the Time for Completion of the Contract" (Exh. [Pak.] CM-76).

 

See 1997 Contract. This date was extended to 31 December 2002 by Addendum No. 9 dated
17 April 2000 (see infra J§ 24-28).

During the same period, Bayindir also issued several claims for delay in the settlement of
Bayindir’s monthly progress payments (IPC).

Under the agreement reached during the meeting of 18 February 2000, it was decided, inter
alia, that "December 2002 as the new completion date for the Project with about one year
advance completion of two sections from Islamabad to Burhan and Indus to Mardan" (Exh.
Bay.] B13). Among other new conditions that were not contemplated by the agreement of 18
February 2000, Addendum No. 9 provided that Bayindir had to “complete the two Priority
Sections mentioned therein by 23 March 2001.” It is Bayindir’s contention that it accepted this
new demand by NHA “[aJs a result of the pressure, coercion and duress exercised by Pakistan”

(BAp.5 13).

By letter of 11 December 2000, Bayindir disputed the sub-clause 46.1 notice and
referred to a number of reasons why it was entitled to an extension of time (Exh. [Pak.
CM-78). In several letters sent shortly thereafter to Bayindir, Mr. Bridger observed that
there were no significant reasons preventing Bayindir from achieving the required
targets (Exh. [Pak.] RB-58) and proposed to hold a meeting with Bayindir "to discuss in
detail feasible dates for completion of all remaining works in Section-| (Part-I) to ensure
overall completion of Part | by March 23, 2001" (Exh. [Pak.] CM-80). By late December
2000, the Engineer's Representative further reminded Bayindir of the need to submit a
revised program for the completion of the Priority Sections (Exh. [Pak.] CM-82).

At a contract progress meeting on 4 January 2001, Bayindir's representatives
announced that a revised program was under preparation and would be submitted in
the following week (Exh. [Pak.] RB-99). A few days later, on 13 January 2001, Bayindir
contended however that the sub-clause 46.1 notice was unjustified and announced a
detailed claim for extension for the following week. Two days later, it submitted EOT
03 for the completion of the two Priority Sections by October instead of March 2001,
asserting primarily that NHA had failed “to hand over the site pursuant to Addendum
No. 9” (Exh. [Bay.] B-15). At the same time, Bayindir submitted a revised program for
the completion of the works.

At another contract progress meeting on 30 January 2001, Mr. Bridger noted that he
was very much concerned about Bayindir's lack of progress, in particular in connection
with the productivity levels in the Priority Sections 1 and 5. He further added that
"shortage of equipment/machinery available with BCI [was] the obvious cause of
delays" and that he had long been reminding this to Bayindir (Exh. [Pak.] RB-100).

On 26 February 2001, the President of Bayindir Construction, Mr. Sadik Can, asked the
Turkish Ambassador in Islamabad to arrange an opportunity for him "to explain to H.E.
the Minister for Communications and the Chairman of National Highway Authority
about our continuing efforts and sincere desire to achieve the completion of this
prestigious Project" (Exh. [Pak.] CM-180). The Ambassador proposed a "high level
meeting between the Company and National Highway Authority" (Exh. [Pak.] CM-181
and Exh. [Pak.] CM-182), which took place on 19 March 2001. The contents of this
meeting are disputed and will be discussed later. It is however established that,

following this meeting, Mr. Bridger wrote to Bayindir observing that the list of
obstructions referred to by Bayindir at the meeting was "obsolete and in no way
indicative of the situation at site" (Exh. [Pak.] RB-67).

In the meantime, Mr. Bridger had again expressed concern about the insufficient
progress on the Priority Sections and mentioned that the Contract provided for
liquidated damages under such circumstances (Exh. [Pak.] CM-92). Bayindir replied
shortly thereafter that the delays were due to the reasons explained in EOT 03 and that
the imposition of liquidated damages would be in breach of the Contract (Exh. [Pak.
CM-93).

The draft minutes of the contract progress meeting of 29 March 2001 referred to a joint
meeting, held on 21 March 2001 at NHA headquarters, during which Bayindir had
informed that "US$ 16 Million worth PIB equipment (including spares) currently on site
[was] all that BCI shall be handling over to NHA upon completion and nothing more"
(Exh. [Bay.] CX-153). According to this document "BCI also claimed that they are not
contractually obliged to meet the shortfall as stated by PMC/NHA, PMC/NHA is
presently reviewing this stand of BCI under the terms of the Contract." A few days
later, Mr. Bridger requested Bayindir to revise its position on permanent equipment
(Exh. [Pak.] RB-54). Bayindir replied on 7 April 2001 disputing that it was required to
import any specific quantity of equipment on a permanent basis (Exh. [Pak.] RB-54).

On 3 April 2001, in response to Bayindir's EOT 03, a limited extension of 27 days for
Part | was communicated to Bayindir (Exh. [Pak.] CM-101). Bayindir challenged such
extension and referred it to the Engineer for a decision pursuant to Clause 67.1 of the
Contract (Exh. [Pak.] R-20).

On 12 April 2001, the Chairman of NHA made a presentation to General Musharraf
regarding inter alia the M-1 Project (Exh. [Bay.] CX-221). The content of this meeting
is disputed and will be discussed later.

On 14 April 2001, Mr. Bridger wrote to Bayindir stating inter alia that it had failed to
comply with the sub-clause 46.1 notice and that it had come to his attention that
Bayindir was considerably behind in payments to its subcontractors (Exh. [Pak.] RB-

69). Bayindir replied inter alia reiterating its entitlement to a longer extension of time
and referring to the pending decision of the Engineer under Clause 67.1 (Exh. [Pak.
CM-107).

On 19 April 2001, the Engineer certified to NHA that "pursuant to Sub-Clause 63.1/b(ii)
of the Conditions of Contract in [his] opinion the Contractor without reasonable excuse
has failed to proceed with the Works, within 28 days after receiving notice pursuant to
Sub-Clause 46.1 of the Conditions of Contract" (Exh. [Pak.] R-22).

On 20 April 2001, NHA informed Bayindir that liquidated damages would be imposed
on Bayindir for late completion of the two Priority Sections with effect from 20 April
2001; that is, the end of the limited extension granted on 3 April 2001 (Exh. [Bay.] B-
20). On the same day, Bayindir notified NHA that it had been unable to complete the
Priority Sections “due to reasons beyond [its] control” and requested that “the
procedure [i.e. the submission of EOT 03 to the Engineer for decision under Clause
67.1] be allowed to follow to determine [its] entitlement for time extension” (Exh. [Bay.
B-21). It is therefore undisputed that the two Priority Sections were not completed on
the dates set in Addendum No. 9 (23 March 2001) extended under EOT 03.

On 23 April 2001, NHA served a “Notice of Termination of Contract” upon Bayindir
requiring the latter to hand over possession of the site within 14 days (Exh. [Bay.] B-
26). Thereafter, staff from the Frontier Works Organization (“FWO”), the civil
engineering section of the Pakistani army, secured the site and Bayindir’s personnel
were evacuated.

On 23 December 2002, NHA concluded a contract for the “Completion of Balance
Works of Islamabad — Peshawar Motorway (M-1) Project" with “M/s Pakistan Motorway
Contractors Joint Venture (PMC JV)” providing for a completion period of 1460 days
(Exh. [Bay.] CX-29).

Related litigation

From January to July 2001, Bayindir served several notices of intention to commence
arbitration pursuant to sub-clause 67.1 of the Contract. The arbitration was not
pursued, although the matters remained unsettled.’

On 30 April 2001, Bayindir filed a constitutional challenge against the notice of
termination served by NHA before the Lahore High Court (Exh. [Pak.] D-15). A few
days later, on 7 May 2001, the Lahore High Court dismissed Bayindir’s constitutional
challenge on the ground that the Contract contained an arbitration clause (Exh. [Pak.
D-16, in particular pp. 17-18).

Between 2001 and early 2003, NHA raised a series of claims against Bayindir and
served a notice of arbitration. On 31 March 2003, NHA sought Bayindir’s concurrence
in the appointment of a sole arbitrator. Bayindir replied on 10 April 2003 that it had
already submitted the matter to ICSID and requested that the award in the ICSID
arbitration be awaited (Exh. [Pak.] D-23).

On 5 January 2004, NHA applied for the appointment of an arbitrator in Pakistan under
section 20 of the Arbitration Act 1940. On 28 May 2004, the Court of Civil Judge in
Islamabad appointed Mr. Justice (Retd.) Afzal Lone as arbitrator. The court
subsequently upheld an objection of NHA (claiming that Mr. Lone was too closely
linked with the previous government of Pakistan, that is the government that had
decided to revive the Contract in 1997) and appointed Mr. Justice (Retd.) Zahid.
Following a request by Pakistan, NHA moved for an extension of time limits in such a
manner that the arbitration would not proceed prior to this Tribunal’s Decision on
Jurisdiction. After the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction (14 November 2005), the
Claimant requested the Tribunal to recommend, by way of a provisional measure, that

With specific regard to a claim introduced on 7 September 2001, concerning escalation
payment, Bayindir filed an application under Section 20 of the 1940 Arbitration Act for the
appointment of an arbitrator on 19 April 2001 (Exh. [Pak.] D-13). The application was dismissed
as premature (failing notice under sub-clause 67.4 of the Contract) on 24 March 2003 (Exh.
Pak.] D-17). An appeal against this decision was dismissed as withdrawn (Exh. [Pak.] D-19).
An appeal against this decision was dismissed as withdrawn by the Supreme Court of Pakistan
on 16 November 2003.

the Respondent desist from pursuing the arbitration in Pakistan. By Procedural Order
No. 12 of 14 April 2008, the Tribunal rejected Bayindir's application.

In the meantime, on 24 April 2001, NHA had called the Mobilisation Advance
Guarantees in an amount of approximately USD 100,000,000. Bayindir obtained an
order from the Turkish courts enjoining the Banks from paying. This injunction was
lifted on 12 September 2003. Execution proceedings against the Banks, to which
Bayindir is not a party, are currently stayed following this Tribunal’s Procedural Order
No. 1 (PO#1) that Pakistan take steps to ensure that NHA does not enforce any final
judgment it may obtain from the Turkish courts with regard to the Mobilisation Advance
Guarantees.

On 26 April 2006, NHA filed an action against Is Bank for the collection of the interest
accrued (and to accrue) on the amount of part of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees.
On 14 March 2007, Is Bank filed an application before the same court requesting that
no default interest be deemed to have accrued, since NHA had not sought to enforce
the judgment granted in its favour. In its response dated 10 April 2007, NHA disputed
ls Bank’s contentions based in particular on the fact that the first encashment request
was made well before the Tribunal’s first decision and that immediately after the
encashment request, Is Bank and Bayindir colluded to obtain an order from this
Tribunal.

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 11 of 14 April 2008 (PO#11), the Claimant was
directed to take the steps necessary and use its best endeavours to procure the
withdrawal by Is Bank of its application dated 14 March 2007. By letter of 24 July
2008, the Claimant informed the Tribunal and the Respondent that Is Bank was
prepared to agree with NHA to suspend the Turkish Court proceedings over NHA's
claim for interest until the Tribunal's Award. On 1 August 2008, the Respondent
opposed the Claimant's proposal and requested security. The procedure following the
Respondent's request is described infra at paragraphs 64-66.

After a long and extensive exchange of correspondence between Bayindir,° Pakistan,"°
NHA" and the Centre, on 1 December 2003, the Secretary-General of the Centre
registered Bayindir’s RA, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the “ICSID
Convention” or “the Convention”). On the same date, the Secretary-General, in
accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the Parties of the registration of the Request
and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.

In the absence of agreement between the Parties, on 6 February 2004, Bayindir
elected to submit the arbitration to a panel of three arbitrators, as provided in Article
37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and appointed Prof. Karl-Heinz Béckstiegel, a
national of Germany. On 26 February 2004, Pakistan appointed Sir Franklin Berman, a
national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. On 27 April 2004, the Parties agreed to
appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as the President of
the Tribunal.

On 15 June 2004, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), notified the
parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal
was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that

In particular, on 10 February 2003, Bayindir supplemented its RA by the submission of a
Volume III, with 13 exhibits (Exh [Bay.] B-41 to B-53).

In particular, on 23 May 2002, the Republic of Pakistan stated that “[t]he nomination of
Secretary Communication by [Bayindir] is without any relevance to the terms of Contract. In
view of provisions of Contract Agreement and various guarantees given by [Bayindir] to NHA for
faithful performance of [Bayindir]'s obligations and against Mobilization Advance; NHA is the
party to the Contract and not the Secretary Communication. The alleged dispute is manifestly
outside the jurisdiction of the Centre, pursuant to sub-para. 1 Article 25, sub-para. 3 of Article
36, sub-para. 1(b) of Rule 6 of INSTITUTION RULE of the Centre. The contents of the requests
by [Bayindir] are in contravention to Rule 2 of the INSTITUTION RULE of the Centre”
(Pakistan's submission of 23 May 2002). The Government of Pakistan further “requested that
all future communication and notices if required, regarding the subject issue, are to be sent to
the [NHA]” (Pakistan's submission of 19 February 2003).

In particular, on 28 August 2003, NHA submitted its “Observation and Reply to ICSID” with
reference to Bayindir’s RA. In its submission NHA concluded that “[t]he documented statements
as given in this submission provide further material to conclude the fact that Bayindir had never
been an Investor neither the dispute referred to ICSID has any bearing with the relevant
provision of BIT. Therefore, the ‘Request for Arbitration’ submitted by Bayindir to ICSID is void
of merits at its own account and manifestly beyond the jurisdiction of ICSID. Therefore, the
Secretary General is requested to refuse the registration of Bayindir's ‘Request for Arbitration’
pursuant to Article 36(3) and institution Rule 6(1)(b) of the Convention” (NHA’s submission of 28
August 2003, p. 2, emphasis in the original).

date. The same letter informed the Parties that Mr. José-Antonio Rivas, Counsel,
ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.’

THE PROCEEDINGS ON PROVISIONAL MEASURES

On 20 July 2004, Bayindir submitted a Request for Provisional Measures (RP), seeking
in substance recommendations by the Tribunal that the Respondent stay all
proceedings pending before the Courts of Pakistan and Turkey. On 27 August 2004,
Pakistan filed its Response to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (Resp RP).

The Arbitral Tribunal held a session on procedural matters and provisional measures
(the “preliminary hearing”) on 24 September 2004, at the offices of the World Bank in
Paris. At the outset of the preliminary hearing, the Parties expressed agreement that
the Tribunal had been properly constituted (Arbitration Rule 6) and stated that they had
no objections in this respect. The Parties further agreed on a set of procedural rules to
apply to the present proceedings. The preliminary hearing was tape-recorded, a
verbatim transcript was taken and later distributed to the Parties (Tr. P.).

During the course of the preliminary hearing, the Parties’ counsel also presented oral
arguments on Bayindir’s request for provisional measures. At the end of the
preliminary hearing, Bayindir withdrew its request seeking a stay of the arbitration
pending in Pakistan between NHA and Bayindir before the sole arbitrator, Mr. Justice
(Retd.) Zahid,'* as a result of an offer by Pakistan to request NHA to move for an
extension of the time limits fixed in the latter in such a manner that the Pakistani
arbitration would not proceed before this Tribunal rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction
(Tr. P. 153:17-155:25).

On 29 November 2004, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on the RP (PO#1), which
provided as follows:

In the course of the proceedings, Mr. Rivas was replaced by Ms. Martina Polasek, Counsel,
ICSID, on 11 May 2005.

As amended at the preliminary hearing, this request read as follows: “1. The Parties
immediately take all steps required to obtain a temporary stay of all proceedings brought under
the Pakistan Arbitration Act 1940 and pending before the Courts of Pakistan and/or before an
arbitrator” (Bayindir’s amended Request for provisional measures submitted at the preliminary
hearing of 24 September 2004).

56.

57.

58.

Having reviewed the Claimant's and the Respondent's written submissions and
having heard oral argument, the Tribunal issues the following order:

(i) The Tribunal acknowledges that Bayindir withdrew the request seeking a
stay of the Pakistani arbitration as a result of an offer of Pakistan to
request NHA to move for an extension of time limits in such a manner that
that arbitration will not proceed prior to this Tribunal’s decision on
jurisdiction.

(ii) The Tribunal recommends that Pakistan take whatever steps may be
necessary to ensure that NHA does not enforce any final judgment it may
obtain from the Turkish courts with regard to the Mobilisation Advance
Guarantees. This recommendation remains in effect until: (a) an arbitral
award declining jurisdiction is issued; or (b) an arbitral award is rendered
on the merits; or (c)-any other order of the Tribunal amending the
recommendations is issued; whichever comes first.

(iii) The Tribunal dismisses Pakistan’s request to recommend, as a matter of
principle, that Bayindir should provide security for Pakistan's costs.

(iv) The Tribunal will rule on the costs of this application in its decision on
jurisdiction or, if it asserts jurisdiction, in its decision on the merits of the
dispute.

(PO#1 4.78)

As a threshold matter in its decision on provisional measures, the Tribunal emphasized
that the reasons leading to such decision were “without prejudice to a later decision of
this Tribunal on Pakistan’s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal” (PO#1 4 40).

NHA later obtained a final judgment from the Turkish courts with regard to the
encashment of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees. On 26 April 2006, NHA filed an
action against Is Bank for the collection of the interest accrued (and to accrue until the
date of payment) on the amount of part of these Guarantees. On 14 March 2007, Is
Bank filed an application before the same court requesting that no default interest be
deemed to have accrued, since NHA had not sought to enforce the judgment granted
in its favour.

On 1 November 2007, Pakistan filed a request for provisional measures seeking that
Bayindir ensures the withdrawal of Is Bank’s application of 14 March 2007. On 30
November 2007, Bayindir filed a response to Pakistan's request. In accordance with
the directions of the Tribunal, the Parties further submitted a reply and a rejoinder,
respectively, on 19 December 2007 and on 7 January 2008.

59.

60.

61.

On 14 April 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 (PO#11) on the
Respondent's request for provisional measures. The operative part of PO#11 provided
as follows:

On the basis of the foregoing reasons, having reviewed the parties’ written
submissions, the Tribunal issues the following order:

(i) Bayindir shall take whatever steps may be necessary and use its best
endeavours to procure the withdrawal by Is Bank of its application
dated 14 March 2007;

(ii) In accordance with the rationale of the Tribunal’s decision of 29
November 2004, Pakistan shall take whatever steps may be necessary
to ensure that NHA does not enforce any final judgment it may obtain
from the Turkish courts with regard to the encashment of interest on
the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees;

(iii) The foregoing directions remain in effect until (a) an arbitral award is
rendered on the merits; or (b):they are amended or revoked by order of
the Tribunal;

(iv) The Tribunal will rule on the costs of this application in its decision on
the merits of the dispute.

Po#11, 441

At the same time, on 30 November 2007, Bayindir filed a request for provisional
measures seeking in substance the Tribunal’s recommendation that NHA be caused to
discontinue the arbitration under way in Pakistan with regard to the Contract. On 19
December 2007, Pakistan submitted a response to Bayindir’s Request seeking its
dismissal. In accordance with the directions of the Tribunal, the Parties further
submitted a reply and a rejoinder, respectively, on 7 and 16 January 2008.

Also on 14 April 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (PO#12) on the
Claimant's request for provisional measures. The operative part of PO#12 provided as
follows:

On the basis of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal:

(i) denies Bayindir’s request “that Respondent should be instructed to
ensure that NHA desists from pursuing the arbitration in Pakistan that
was suspended under Procedural Order No. 1, which NHA has since
restarted, or be caused to suspend such, proceedings pending
resolution of this dispute before this Tribunal";

(ii) will rule on the costs of this application in its decision on the merits.

67.

At the end of the hearing on the merits, the Respondent inquired into the
implementation of PO#11 and the Claimant undertook to revert shortly to the
Respondent and the Tribunal on this issue.

By letter of 16 June 2008, the Claimant advised that it had again urged Is Bank to act
promptly to respect the Tribunal's instructions given in PO#11 and attached a copy of
its letter to this effect, dated 13 June 2008, as well as an English translation.

By letter of 24 July 2008, the Claimant informed the Tribunal and the Respondent that
Is Bank was prepared to agree with NHA to suspend the Turkish Court proceedings
over NHA's claim for interest until the Tribunal's award on the merits. In accordance
with the Tribunal's directions, on 1 August 2008, the Respondent filed a response in
which it opposed the Claimant's proposal as insufficient and requested the Tribunal,
inter alia, to order the Claimant to provide security for the amount of interest that may
be forgone by NHA in case Is Bank's application would be successful. In accordance
with the directions of the Tribunal, the Parties further submitted a reply and a rejoinder,
respectively on 8 and 14 August 2008.

On 19 August 2008, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's request for security, and
invited the Parties to revert, if possible jointly, regarding the implementation of the
proposal communicated by the Claimant in its letter of 24 July 2008.

By letter of 29 August 2008, the Respondent stated that it could not agree with the
Claimant on such implementation. The Claimant responded by letter of 4 September
2008, noting that it had again written to Is Bank in connection with PO#11. On 10
September 2008, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to clarify its position. In
accordance with these directions, the Respondent clarified its position by letter of 26
September 2008, and the Claimant replied by letter of 10 October 2008. The issue
raised by these submissions is addressed in section IV(E) of this Award.

THE JURISDICTIONAL PHASE

In accordance with the timetable agreed during the preliminary hearing, on 31
December 2004, Pakistan submitted its Memorial on jurisdictional objections (Mem. J.)
accompanied by one volume of contractual documents (Annexes C-1 to C-13), four

17

69.

70.

71.

72.

volumes of legal materials (Annexes L-1 to L-43) and one volume of Documentary
Exhibits (Exhibits 1 to 35). Pakistan did not append any witness statement or expert
opinion.

Pursuant to the timetable, Bayindir submitted its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction on 31
March 2005, (C-Mem. J.) accompanied by one volume of documentary evidence (CX-
79 to CX-124) and five volumes of legal materials (Exhibits CLEX-18 to CLEX-55).
Bayindir did not append any written witness statement or expert opinion.

On 9 May 2005, still according to the timetable, Pakistan submitted its Reply on
jurisdiction (Reply J.) accompanied by one volume of documentary exhibits (Exhibits R-
1 to R-74) and one volume of legal materials (Exhibits RL-1 to RL-22).

Within the extension of time allowed by the Tribunal, on 17 June 2005, Bayindir
submitted its Rejoinder on jurisdiction (Rejoinder J.) accompanied by one volume of
documentary exhibits (Exhibits CX-125 to CX-156)"* and one volume of legal materials
(Exhibits CLEX-56 to CLEX-61).

On 5 July 2005, pursuant to Article 19 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal
invited Pakistan to file a written response limited to the new factual allegations
contained in paragraphs 101 to 104 of the Rejoinder J. on or before 15 July 2005.

On 7 July 2005, the Tribunal held a preparatory telephone conference to organize the
hearing on jurisdiction for which the dates of 25, 26 and 27 July 2005 had previously
been retained. None of the Parties having submitted witness statements or expert
opinions, it was agreed that the hearing on jurisdiction would be limited to oral
arguments.

At the outset of the hearing on jurisdiction (Tr. J, 17, 29-39), Pakistan pointed out that some of
these exhibits - namely Exh. [Bay.] CX-127, an internal letter dated 4 November 2000; Exh.
Bay.] CX-131, an internal letter dated 2 May 2001; Exh.[Bay.] CX-145, an internal letter of June
2001; Exh. [Bay.] CX-146, an internal letter dated May 2001; Exh. [Bay.] CX-151, an internal
letter of April 2001; Exh. [Bay.] CX-152, a confidential letter from the World Bank dated 26 May
2000 to the Government of Pakistan; Exh. [Bay.] CX-153, a confidential letter from the World
Bank to the Government of Pakistan dated 5 June 2000 - constituted “confidential and
privileged legal materials which have apparently been taken from the files of the Government of
Pakistan” (Ir. J.. 17, 26-28). Pakistan did not however object to their production in this
arbitration.

 

73.

74.

On 22 July 2005, Counsel for the Respondent informed the Tribunal that Pakistan had
ratified the New York Convention and attached the ratification instrument dated 9 June,
deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 14 July. He added that
the New York Convention had been enacted in the form of the Recognition of
Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements and Foreign Arbitral Awards Ordinance of
2005, which had come into force with retroactive effect on 14 July 2005."°

The Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on jurisdiction from 25 July 2005, starting at
11:00 am, to 26 July 2005, ending at 4:15 pm, at the Salons des Arts et Métiers, 9 bis
avenue d'léna, Paris. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal'® and the Secretary,
the following persons attended the jurisdictional hearing:

During the jurisdictional hearing, Messrs. Veeder, Greenwood, Wordsworth and Bundy
addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Pakistan and Mr. Griffith addressed the Tribunal on
behalf of Bayindir. At the outset of the hearing, Mr. Griffith stated on behalf of Bayindir
that it was not pursuing any claims on the basis of the Contract and was henceforth
only bringing claims based on the Treaty. Pakistan replied that an earlier withdrawal
would have saved substantial costs and insisted that its costs incurred to defend the
Contract claims be compensated.

The jurisdictional hearing was tape-recorded, a verbatim transcript was taken and later
distributed to the Parties (Tr. J.). It ended earlier than scheduled, both Parties having
fully presented their arguments and agreeing to such change of schedule.

On 14 November 2005, the Tribunal issued a decision ("Decision on Jurisdiction"),
which is attached to this Award, concluding that it had jurisdiction over the claims
asserted by Bayindir against Pakistan for breaches of the Treaty, namely for breaches
of provisions on national and most favoured nation treatment, fair and equitable
treatment and expropriation without compensation (hereinafter generally referred to as
“Treaty Claims”). The operative part of the Decision on Jurisdiction stated:

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal makes the following decision:

a) The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration.

b) The Tribunal denies Respondent's application to suspend these proceedings.

c) The Tribunal will, accordingly, make the necessary order for the continuation of the
proceedings on the merits.

d) The decision on costs is deferred to the second phase of the arbitration on the merits.

(Decision on Jurisdiction, operative part).

THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE MERITS

In accordance with the timetable set by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 2 of 23
December 2005 (PO#2), on 25 April 2006, Bayindir submitted its Memorial on the
merits (Mem. M.) accompanied by one volume of contractual documents (exhibits C-1
to C-18), nine volumes of documentary exhibits (exhibits CX-1 to CX-123), including

20

two witness statements (exhibits CX-7 and CX-68, this latter accompanied by
annexures A to Z), and four volumes of legal exhibits (exhibits CLEX-1 to CLEX-47).

On 25 August 2006, pursuant to the same timetable, Pakistan submitted its Counter-
Memorial on the merits (C-Mem. M.) accompanied by four volumes of documentary
evidence (exhibits CM-1 to CM-197), three volumes of witness statements (with five
witness statements, the first one being accompanied by exhibits RB-1 to RB-87) and
two volumes of legal materials (Exhibits CM LEX-1 to CM LEX-15).

In accordance with PO#2, as amended by Procedural Order No. 5 of 18 January 2007
(PO#5) and the Tribunal's directions of 19 January 2007, on 21 February 2007 Bayindir
submitted its Reply on the merits (Reply M.) accompanied by two volumes of witness
statements (exhibits CX-124 to CX-127), eight volumes of documentary exhibits
(exhibits CX-128 to CX-261) and two volumes of legal materials (exhibits CLEX-48 to
CLEX-74).

On 30 April 2007, after considering the views of the Parties, the Tribunal decided to
invite Mr. John Wall of the World Bank to appear as a witness to be questioned by the
Tribunal on the basis of a list of questions to be submitted to him in advance. Further,
in accordance with PO#5, the Parties filed their list of witnesses and experts for direct
and cross-examination on 29 May 2007.

On 24 May 2007, according to PO#2, PO#5, and the Tribunal's directions of 4 May
2007, Pakistan submitted its Rejoinder on the merits (Rej. M.) accompanied by three
volumes of documentary exhibits (exhibits R-1 to R-79), four volumes of witness
statements and expert opinions with annexures and five volumes of legal materials
(exhibits R LEX-1 to R LEX-50).

By letter of 3 June 2007, the Claimant requested inter alia that “the Tribunal adopt an
appropriate order, in consultation with the parties, for rescheduling of the oral hearing”
and that it also reschedule the telephone conference to be held on 5 June 2007.

On the following day, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Bayindir’s request for
postponement and informed the Parties that it had decided to maintain the telephone

21

conference and to discuss the Claimant's request for postponement of the hearing at
the outset of the telephone conference.

The telephone conference was held as scheduled. During the course of the telephone
conference, the Tribunal drew the Parties’ attention to the fact that a postponement of
the hearing would lead to a significant delay in the proceedings, since the Tribunal’s
next availability for a 10-day hearing was in May 2008. Bayindir nevertheless
confirmed its request and Pakistan agreed with it. It was further agreed that the Parties
would jointly report to the Tribunal on the status and on the need to resume the
proceedings by 10 August 2007.

On this basis, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 of 20 June 2007 (PO#8) inter
alia postponing the hearing on the merits, inviting the Parties to report on 10 August
2007 and reserving the period from 26 May to 4 June 2008 in case a hearing would be
needed.

The Parties reported as scheduled and requested that the proceedings be resumed.
They submitted a common position on the duration of the hearing and other procedural
matters and separate proposals on the time allocation and the schedule of the hearing.

On 22 August 2007, in accordance with PO#8, the Tribunal held another telephone
conference to address issues arising from the Parties’ joint report of 10 August 2007.
Following this telephone conference, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 of 27
September 2007 (PO#9) giving detailed directions for the conduct of the hearing on the
merits to be held from 26 May 2008 to 4 June 2008.

Shortly before the hearing, on 12 May 2008, the Tribunal held a preparatory telephone
conference to address any outstanding organizational issues after which it issued
further directions for the hearing.

The Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on the merits from 26 May to 4 June 2008 at the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution, in London. In addition to the Members of
the Tribunal," the following persons attended the hearing on the merits:

With the agreement of the Parties, Dr. Jorge E. Vifiuales, an attorney practising in the law firm
of the President of the Tribunal, attended the hearing.

extended to 26 September 2008. Following the hearing the Tribunal confirmed these
directions in writing.

Accordingly, the Parties submitted simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 16 July 2008.

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The Tribunal has deliberated and thoroughly considered the Parties’ written
submissions on the merits and the oral arguments delivered in the course of the
evidentiary hearing. It will now summarize the positions of the Parties (Ill) and analyze
the issues in dispute (IV) before setting out the relief granted (V).

BAYINDIR’S POSITION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

Bayindir's position is essentially the following:

"[the] Respondent, acting at the highest levels of the Government of Pakistan,
exercised its sovereign prerogative to change government policy about the M-1
motorway in the face of budget shortfalls, advice from international organizations,
and internal opposition to the M-1 Project. While no one would contest the
Government of Pakistan's right to decide that it could no longer afford a
‘Mercedes' motorway, such a decision could not be made without consequences.
The hearing made clear that Respondent sought to escape those consequences
by dressing its policy decision in ill-fitting contractual garb in order to expel
Bayindir from the Project. In so doing, Respondent engaged in unfair and
inequitable conduct, it expropriated Bayindir's investment in the M-1 Project, and
it treated Bayindir less favorably than the Pakistani contractors that replaced
Bayindir on the same Project. Respondent's conduct in violation of the Treaty is
thus manifested in, but is not limited to, the act of expelling Bayindir from the M-1
Project. Respondent's subsequent conduct — in ensuring that Bayindir was
stripped of all prospects of contractual recovery, and in destroying the Bayindir
Group with an unjustified call on the mobilization advance guarantees — also
gave rise to Treaty breaches."

(PHB [Pak.] (3)

More specifically, in its written and oral submissions, Bayindir advanced the following
main contentions:

(i) |The Respondent breached the protections afforded by the Treaty through three
series of actions, involving the expulsion of Bayindir, the conduct following

24

98.

99.

ti)

(iii)

(iv)

Bayindir's expulsion, and the attempted encashment of the Mobilisation Advance
Guarantees;

Pakistan breached the fair and equitable treatment standard to which Bayindir is
entitled on the basis of the MFN clause contained in Article II(1) of the Treaty by
reason of its expulsion of Bayindir for motives unrelated to Bayindir's
performance of the Contract, through its efforts to frustrate and extinguish any
rights Bayindir may have retained under the Contract, and through its arbitrary
and unfair attempts to encash the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees.

Pakistan breached the MFN and national treatment standards contained in Article
Il(1) and (2) of the Treaty by reason of its expulsion of Bayindir to favour local
contractors, its more favourable treatment of both local contractors and other
foreign contractors, its actions following Bayindir's expulsion, and its attempts to
encash the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees.

Pakistan breached the guarantee against expropriation without compensation
given in Article III(1) of the Treaty by reason of its expulsion of Bayindir, its efforts
to complete the deprivation of Bayindir's investment following said expulsion, and
its call on the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees.

On the basis of these contentions, Bayindir requested in its Memorial that the Tribunal

"[Flind the Respondent has violated the Claimant's rights under the Treaty. The
acts and omissions of Pakistan and its emanation, the NHA, for which the
Respondent is internationally responsible, have denied the Claimant fair and
equitable treatment, the most favored nation treatment/national treatment and
have expropriated Claimant's investment without compensation. As a result of
that conduct, Claimant is entitled to and request that the Tribunal award to the
Claimant compensation and damages in the amount of US$ 756,196,108.00
inclusive of compound interest. The conduct of the Respondent has caused
irreparable damage to the reputation of the Claimant in respect of which the
Claimant reserves its right to submit an additional claim in respect thereof.

In addition the Claimant requests that it be awarded litigation costs and
expenses.”

(Mem. M., § 287)

In its Reply, the Claimant requested the following relief:

"In view of the above Bayindir respectfully seeks the following relief from the
Tribunal:

(i) Declaring that Pakistan has breached its obligations under Article II(2) of the
Treaty by failing to observe obligations that it entered into with regard to
Bayindir's investment.

(ii) Declaring that Pakistan has breached its obligations under the Treaty by
failing to accord to Bayindir fair and equitable treatment.

(iii) Declaring that Pakistan has breached Article III of the Treaty by indirectly
expropriating Bayindir's investment without complying with the requirements of
the Treaty.

25

100.

101.

(iv) Ordering Pakistan to pay to Bayindir full compensation and damages in the
amounts set forth below:

a) US$ 22,650,834 payable on account of Certified Payment Certificates;
b) US$ 60,234,608 on account of value of Works completed up till the date
of Expulsion;
c) US$ 34,188,378 on account of value of Machinery, Plant, Equipment,
Spare Parts etc;
d) US$ 4,265,164 on account of Costs of Camp facilities;
e) US$ 3,877,075 on account of value of Custom Guarantee letters;
f) US$ 121,770,030 on account of Loss of Profit;
g) US$ 21,474,234 on account of reimbursement of costs incurred by
Bayindir in anticipation of completing the Project;
h) US$ 219,842,618 on account of Loss of opportunity;
i) US$ 96,600,000 on account of Punitive Damages;
j) Plus pre-and post-award compound interest as prayed for in the
Memorial;
(v) Ordering Pakistan to return to Bayindir the Performance Bond;
(vi) Ordering Pakistan to return the Letters of Guarantee issued by the
consortium of Turkish Banks;
(vii) Ordering Pakistan to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration
proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the cost of
Bayindir's legal representation, plus interest thereon;
(viii) Such other or additional relief as may be appropriate under the Treaty or
may otherwise be just and appropriate in the circumstances of this case."
(Reply M., pp. 200-201).

In its post-hearing submission, the Claimant requested the following relief:

"[Alward it compensation in the amount of US $494.6 million plus interest of 8%
compounded annually. In addition, Respondent must be permanently barred
from enforcing any Turkish court judgments or otherwise seeking to encash the
mobilization advance guarantees. Bayindir also respectfully requests an award
of its legal fees and other costs incurred in connection with this proceeding."
(PHB [Bay.] 4 126)

PAKISTAN’S POSITION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

Pakistan's position is essentially the following:

"Bayindir's claim turns on the allegation that Pakistan treated Bayindir in a way
which was not fair and equitable; its allegations of other treaty breaches are little
more than window dressing and its claim for expropriation flies in the face of
authority and common sense. There is no legal basis on which Bayindir could
succeed in its other claims if it fails on fair and equitable treatment.

In an attempt to sustain that case for unfair and inequitable treatment, Bayindir
has made numerous wild allegations about conspiracy, improper motivation and
bad faith [ ... ] Bayindir bears the burden of proof on those allegations and it has
failed to discharge that burden. On the contrary, the record [ ... ] shows that
there was no conspiracy and no improper motive and that both NHA and the
Government of Pakistan acted in good faith throughout."

(PHB [Pak.] (9 1.17-1.18)

26

102.

103.

104.

More specifically, in its written and oral submissions, Pakistan advanced the following

main arguments:

(i)

ti)

(iv)

Bayindir's claim that it was denied fair and equitable treatment is unfounded as it
is not based on any specific fair and equitable treatment clause that could be
applied through the MFN clause in the Treaty, and Bayindir has failed to establish
that its expulsion as well as Pakistan's acts following said expulsion were
anything else than Pakistan's legitimate exercise of its rights under the Contract;
Bayindir's claims for breach of the MFN and national treatment clauses contained
in Article II paragraphs (1) and (2) of the Treaty and discrimination are unfounded
to the extent that Bayindir has failed to establish any conduct of Pakistan aimed
at favouring local or other foreign contractors over Bayindir;

Bayindir's claim for breach of the expropriation clause contained in Article III(1) of
the Treaty is unfounded, in particular because Bayindir's expulsion was in
accordance with the Contract, because Bayindir retained rights under the
Contract to a final settlement, and because the plant and equipment left at the
site were treated in accordance with the Contract;

Bayindir's claim for breach of the expropriation clause in connection with the
attempts to encash the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees is unfounded,
especially because it concerns separate parties, because it is new and the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction over it, and because these guarantees are in any
event not an investment and have not been expropriated.

In reliance on these arguments, Pakistan set forth the following requests in its Counter-

Memorial:

"On the basis of the facts and legal considerations set out in this Counter-
Memorial, and rejecting all contrary submissions made by Bayindir, Pakistan
respectfully requests the Tribunal to adjudge and declare:

(i) that the Respondent has not breached the Pakistan-Turkey Treaty with
respect to the claims introduced by the Claimant, and that the Claimant's claims
are thereby rejected; and

(ii) that the Claimant reimburse the Respondent for the costs and expenses the
Respondent has incurred as a result of this arbitration.”

(C-Mem. M., p. 175).

In its Rejoinder, Pakistan requested the Tribunal to conclude as follows:

"On the basis of the facts and legal considerations set out in this Rejoinder, and
rejecting all contrary submissions made by Bayindir, Pakistan respectfully
requests the Tribunal to adjudge and declare:

27

105.

106.

107.

(i) that the Respondent has not breached the Pakistan-Turkey Treaty with
respect to the claims introduced by the Claimant, and that the Claimant's claims
are thereby rejected; and

(ii) that the Claimant reimburse the Respondent for the costs and expenses the
Respondent has incurred as a result of this arbitration.”

(Rej. M., p. 168).

In its post-hearing submission, Pakistan concluded as follows:

"Pakistan's primary submission is that Bayindir's claim fails and that there is no

liability in damages at all [ ... ].

On the basis of the above, the maximum sum that may be found as owing to

Bayindir is $ US14,612,315, as shown in Table 2 below [... ].

It follows from Table 2 that NHA, not Bayindir, is very substantially out of pocket.

If a set-off were appropriate, NHA would recover the amount of US$78,078,592.

As Table 2 shows, this is an exceptional case, as the Claimant has been paid

very considerable sums up front. That must not, however, impact on the sums

that the Claimant may be awarded in damages. The reality is that Bayindir did

not spend a very significant portion of the mobilisation advance on the Project,

and it should not be allowed to recover on the basis that it did."

(PHB [Pak.] §§] 7.1, 7.126-128).
Pakistan's statement that it may be found to owe at most approximately US$14.6
million reflects an alternative position for the event that the Tribunal would find liability

(PHB [Pak.] 17.1)

While Part | of this Award summarizes the main facts and Part Ill the main arguments
of the Parties, other arguments were made and considered by the Tribunal. They will
be referred to in Part IV to the extent that the Tribunal considers necessary.

ANALYSIS
PRELIMINARY MATTERS

The Tribunal has reviewed all of the numerous arguments presented by the Parties.
The manner in which the Claimant has pleaded its case has not facilitated the
Tribunal's task. Although it has considered the entire record, the Tribunal will rely more
particularly on the arguments last presented by Claimant and concentrate on those
arguments that it itself regards as decisive for the outcome of the dispute.

Before turning to the actual issues raised by the claims, the Tribunal wishes to address
certain preliminary matters, i.e., the law applicable to the merits of the present dispute

28

a.

109.

110.

b.

111.

(a), the attribution of NHA's acts to the Respondent under international law (b); the
applicability ratione temporis of the Treaty (c); the requirements for establishing a treaty
claim in the context of a contractual relationship (d), the allocation of the burden of
proof (e), and the relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards (f).

The law applicable to the merits

The present proceedings are based on the "Agreement between the Republic of
Turkey and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and
Protection of Investments" of 16 March 1995 (the “Treaty”), which entered into force on
3 September 1997. It is common ground that the Tribunal must decide the merits of
the case on the basis of the Treaty. As the Claimant notes, "[treaty claims] are
analyzed under the Treaty's legal standards and advanced under the Treaty's
procedures, not those of the Contract" (PHB [Bay.] { 2). Similarly, the Respondent
states that "... the present case turns on one question: does the conduct of Pakistan
amount to a breach of the bilateral investment treaty between Pakistan and Turkey"
(PHB [Pak.] { 1.4).

In deciding these questions the Tribunal will take into account the applicable rules of
international law."

Attribution of NHA's acts

In their submissions on the merits, both Parties have focused their argumentation on
whether the acts of NHA amounted to an exercise of sovereign authority or merely of
contractual rights. Before dealing with this distinction, the Tribunal must logically first
review whether the acts of NHA allegedly in breach of the Treaty are attributable to
Pakistan.

See Article 42 of the ICSID Convention. See also the Vivendi ad hoc Committee, which held
that a claim based upon a substantive provision of a BIT is “governed by [...] the BIT and by
applicable international law’. Compafiia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v.
Argentine Republic (I\CSID Case No. ARB/97/3) (hereafter, Vivendi v. Argentina), Decision on
Annulment of 3 July 2002, {| 96 and 102; see also Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic (\CSID
Case No. ARB/01/12) (hereafter, Azurix v. Argentina), Award of 14 July 2006, § 67; MTD Equity

v. Chile), Award of 25 May 2004, 87; Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt (ICSID Case
No. ARB/98/4) (hereafter, Wena Hotels v. Egypt), Award of 8 December 2000, 9 78-79.

112.

113.

114.

When specifying in its post-hearing brief the acts in breach of the Treaty, the Claimant
refers to (i) the expulsion of Bayindir, (ii) following the expulsion, the failure by NHA to
proceed to a number of actions under the Contract (such as the evaluation of the works
completed, the certification of certain IPAs (Interim Payment Application), the payment
of certain IPCs, or the refusal to acknowledge and certify extensions of time granted by
the Engineer) and NHA's claim for approximately US$ 1 billion in the Pakistani
arbitration, and (iii) the actions taken in connection with the encashment of the
Mobilisation Advance Guarantees.

In respect of each of these three series of actions, Bayindir asserts a breach of the
FET, non-discrimination and expropriation protections of the Treaty (see for instance
PHB [Bay. 80, 94, 106. 108). From a contractual standpoint, these actions were
those of NHA and not of the Government of Pakistan. The Tribunal must therefore
determine whether they are attributable to the Respondent under the international law
rules of attribution reflected in Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the International Law Commission's
Articles on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts ("ILC Articles")."°

Without clearly distinguishing between each of these three series of acts, the Claimant
argues in essence that the Government of Pakistan, in the exercise of its sovereign
prerogatives, took the decisions that led to the violation of Bayindir's rights under the
Treaty, and that these decisions were subsequently implemented by NHA through
contractual means. More specifically, while acknowledging that "[t]he Contract to
construct the M-1 Motorway was entered into between Bayindir and NHA" (PHB [Bay.
(20), the Claimant argues that

"the key decisions with respect to Bayindir's ongoing involvement in the M-1
Project, including ultimately the decision to expel Bayindir, were repeatedly
referred to and taken by others at the highest levels of the Government of
Pakistan, including the head of state of the Islamic Republic. The involvement of
these government actors, above and outside of NHA, in itself demonstrates that
the decision to expel Bayindir was a sovereign and not a contractual act [ ... ] the
record is clear that decisions on the M-1 Project were referred to senior
government officials and agencies above NHA, and ultimately to General

Musharraf himself." (PHB [Bay.] § 20)

Articles on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, with commentaries (2001),
Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, Vol. Il, Part Two. The ILC Articles are
widely regarded as expressing current customary international law, see J. Crawford, The
International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility — Introduction, Text and
Commentaries, 2002.

30

115.

116.

117.

Referring to the decision in Wena Hotels,” Bayindir further contends that even if the
Tribunal were to conclude that the Respondent had no involvement in the Treaty-
violative acts taken against Bayindir, the record shows that the Respondent "took no
steps to prevent the unjustified expropriation of Bayindir's investment or the
discriminatory and unfair treatment to which Bayindir was subjected" (PHB [Bay.] 4 33).
More specifically, it asserts that

"[t]here can be no question that the Government of Pakistan at a minimum was
well aware of the expulsion of Bayindir and the attempted encashment of the
guarantees. The expulsion was discussed with General Musharraf, and the
attempted encashment was coordinated with Pakistan's Foreign Office. At the
very least, Respondent stood by and did not act to protect Bayindir or its
investment from mistreatment by entities under its control." (PHB [Bay.] 33).

Pakistan concedes that there was some government involvement, but insists that the
decisions allegedly in breach of the Treaty were taken in the exercise of NHA's
contractual rights as opposed to the exercise of sovereign prerogatives, or in the words
used in the post-hearing brief:

"the decision to expel was made by NHA, acting on its own following the
issuance of a Clause 63.1 Certification by the Engineer, subsequent to 12 April
2001, albeit with the high level approval that — so far as concerns the general
diplomatic fallout — it could act in accordance with the terms of the Contract [ ... ]
the case comes down to the exercise by NHA of a contractual right, divorced
from interference by the State. The fact that President Musharraf might have,
but did not, discourage NHA from exercising its contractual rights because of
broader diplomatic reasons in no way constitutes relevant interference." (PHB

Pak.] 42.76, 2.78)

It is not disputed that it was NHA which exercised the rights under the Contract in a
manner allegedly in breach of the Treaty. The debate thus hinges on the following
questions: (i) whether NHA is an organ of the State; (ii) whether NHA is an
instrumentality acting in the exercise of governmental powers; and (iii) whether NHA
acted under the direction or control of the State. These issues were not clearly
articulated in the Parties' submissions and pleadings on the merits, but they received
attention in earlier phases of the proceedings. The Tribunal considers nevertheless
that issues (i) to (iii) are implied in the Parties' arguments and constitute a necessary
step in the Tribunal's analysis.

Wena Hotels v. Egypt, supra footnote 18, J 99.

31

118.

119.

Given NHA's position as Bayindir's contract partner, the logical starting point for the
Tribunal's analysis is question (i). In its RP, Bayindir argued that Pakistan was the
proper party and that:

“attempts to view NHA as somehow structurally or functionally distinct from the
Government of Pakistan are erroneous as can be seen on review of, inter alia,
the following:

-NHA's constituting statute, which places the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance
and Minister of Communications in control of this entity [ ... ]

-The purposes and duties of NHA are clearly national in scope, as both the
name ‘National Highway Authority' and the purposes of the NHA Act make plain

-In both the 1993 Contract and 1997 Contract, Bayindir contracted with
"NATIONAL HIGHWAY AUTHORITY, GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN' [ ... ]
-The February 9, 2000 Minutes of Meeting which recorded the extensions of
time permitted to Bayindir for the one of the Priority Sections, were negotiated
with, and then recorded by, the Government of Pakistan [ ... ] After Bayindir had
been expelled from Site, it was the Pakistani Ministry of Communications which
explained on behalf of the Pakistan Government that it was to the benefit of the
Government and local contractors that Bayindir was removed [ ... ]

- Claim concerns BIT breaches, not contractual breaches"

(RP {129}

Pakistan submits that NHA is a distinct legal personality under the laws of Pakistan
(Mem. J., 4.17). The Tribunal shares this view. Indeed, pursuant to section 3(2) of the
National Highway Authority Act of 1991 ("NHA Act"), NHA is a "body corporate having
perpetual succession and a common seal with power to acquire, hold and dispose of
property, and may in its own name sue and be sued" (Exh. [Bay] RP-1). The fact that
there may be links between NHA and some sections of the Government of Pakistan
does not mean that the two are not distinct. State entities and agencies do not operate
in an institutional or regulatory vacuum. They normally have links with other authorities
as well as with the government. Because of its separate legal status, the Tribunal
discards the possibility of treating NHA as a State organ under Article 4 of the ILC
Articles. The Claimant also asserts, however, that NHA's conduct was in fact the mere
execution of decisions taken by government officials. This argument would appear to
suggest that the acts incriminated emanate from government officials, who are
themselves organs of the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles. Given that — as
already indicated above — NHA is a separate legal entity and that the acts in question
are those of NHA as a party to the Contract, the Tribunal considers that there are no
grounds for attribution by virtue of Article 4.

32

120.

121.

122.

123.

As a next step, the Tribunal must review whether NHA's conduct may be attributable
pursuant to Article 5 (State instrumentalities) of the ILC Articles. Article 5 ILC reads as
follows:

"The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4

but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the

governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international

law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular

instance."
It is not disputed that NHA is generally empowered to exercise elements of
governmental authority. Section 10 of the NHA Act vests broad authority in NHA to
take "such measures and exercise such powers it considers necessary or expedient for
carrying out the purposes of this Act," including to "levy, collect or cause to be collected
tolls on National Highways, strategic roads and such other roads as may be entrusted
to it and bridges thereon." Other relevant provisions of the NHA Act are section 12 on
"Powers to eject unauthorized occupants" and section 29 on the NHA's "Power to
enter" upon lands and premises to make inspections.

The existence of these general powers is not however sufficient in itself to bring the
case within Article 5. Attribution under that provision requires in addition that the
instrumentality acted in a sovereign capacity in that particular instance:

"If it is to be regarded as an act of the State for purposes of international

responsibility, the conduct of an entity must accordingly concern governmental

activity and not other private or commercial activity in which the entity may

engage."
To determine whether NHA acted in a sovereign capacity for the different acts at issue,
the Tribunal has had to review the numerous arguments and extensive evidence
presented by the parties. Its detailed analysis will be found later on in this Award when
dealing with the merits of Bayindir's individual claims. It will make for better readability
of the Award, however, if the Tribunal were to signal at this point the first of its main
findings on the question of attribution. This is that (although there are indications in the
opposite direction) the Tribunal is not persuaded on the balance of the evidence
presented to it that in undertaking the actions which are alleged to be in breach of the
Treaty, the NHA was acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority.
The Tribunal’s conclusion is accordingly that these actions are thus not attributable to
Pakistan under Article 5 of the ILC Articles.

Whatever the Tribunal’s finding on that question may be, however, the possibility
remains of attribution to the State under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. Article 8 reads as
follows:

"The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State

under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the

instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the
conduct."

As before in connection with Article 5, in order to assess whether an act was carried
out "on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of" the State, the Tribunal
has reviewed the parties' arguments and extensive evidence. The Tribunal concludes
that each specific act allegedly in breach of the Treaty was a direct consequence of the
decision of the NHA to terminate the Contract, which decision received express
clearance from the Pakistani Government. A detailed analysis of the connections
existing between the decision of the NHA and the involvement of the Pakistani
Government with respect to the termination of the Contract is provided in the Tribunal's
discussion of Bayindir's FET claim, albeit its scope covers the other claims as well. On
this basis, the Tribunal signals the second of its main findings on the question of
attribution, namely that NHA's conduct is attributable to Pakistan under Article 8 of the
ILC Articles.

This finding is comforted by the fact that the Respondent conceded in its oral and
written submissions (see for instance Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 155, 6-23, 4 June 2008.
174, 13-22, 223, 13-16; PHB [Pak. 2.76, 2.78) that the government was involved to
a certain degree in the M-1 Project. So for instance, in the opening statement:

"[O]ne of the refrains you heard this morning repeatedly was, ‘The Government of
Pakistan, contrary to what the Respondent is trying to tell you, kept intervening in
this Contract’. The Government of Pakistan was closely interested in this
Contract, as any responsible Government being asked to stump up hundreds of
millions of Dollars, is going to be. But there is another reason why the
Government of Pakistan was involved, and that is that the Claimant kept asking it
to get involved."

(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 155. 6-17).

Or in the post-hearing brief:

"the decision to expel was made by NHA, acting on its own following the issuance
of a Clause 63.1 Certification by the Engineer, subsequent to 12 April 2001, albeit
with the high level approval that —- so far as concerns the general diplomatic
fallout — it could act in accordance with the terms of the Contract.”

(PHB [Pak.] § 2.76)

34

128.

129.

These statements are consistent with the evidence on record. There was indeed a
certain degree of government involvement, as will be discussed in detail later. During
the hearing on the merits, it became in particular clear that at a meeting held on 12
April 2001, General Musharraf gave clearance to the Chairman of NHA, General
Javed, to resort to the available contract remedies, including termination (Tr. M., 29

 

May 2008, 74-75). Similarly, General Qazi, Minister of Communications, confirmed
that the decision to terminate the Contract could not have been taken without some
guidance from higher levels of the Pakistani government (Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 318-
319).

The Tribunal also notes that attribution under Article 8 is without prejudice to the
characterization of the conduct under consideration as either sovereign or commercial
in nature. For the sake of attribution under this rule, it does not matter that the acts are
commercial, jure gestionis, or contractual. The Commentary to the ILC Articles stresses
this point in the following terms:

"The attribution to the State of conduct in fact authorized by it is widely accepted
in international jurisprudence. In such cases it does not matter that the person or
persons involved are private individuals nor whether their conduct involves
‘governmental activity."

In other words, a finding of attribution does not necessarily entail that the acts under
review qualify as sovereign acts. The Tribunal will address this latter issue in the
context of the discussion of each specific claim whenever relevant.

Finally, the Tribunal is aware that the levels of control required for a finding of
attribution under Article 8 in other factual contexts, such as foreign armed intervention
or international criminal responsibility, may be different. It believes, however, that the
approach developed in such areas of international law is not always adapted to the
realities of international economic law and that they should not prevent a finding of
attribution if the specific facts of an investment dispute so warrant.

Applicability ratione temporis of the Treaty

Another preliminary question concerns the applicability ratione temporis of the Treaty.
Pursuant to Article IX(1), the Treaty "shall apply to investments existing at the time of
entry into force as well as to investments made or acquired thereafter." It is therefore
clear that whether made prior to or after the entry into force of the Treaty on 3
September 1997, an investment benefits from the protections of the Treaty.

However, in accordance with the well-established principle of non-retroactivity of
treaties and absent any indication to the contrary in the text of the Treaty itself, the
protections accorded by the Treaty can only apply to acts committed after its entry into
force.” In the present case, no issue arises in this respect as the disputes arising out
of the events pre-dating the entry into force of the Treaty were settled (see Exh. [Bay.
C-17, C-8). That notwithstanding, the Tribunal considers that acts pre-dating the entry

 

into force can be taken into account to the extent that they may assist in understanding
the significance of acts which do fall within the scope of the Treaty ratione temporis.

Treaty claim in the context of a contractual relationship

The Parties are at odds on the significance of contract matters in the assessment of
treaty claims. Referring to Vivendi 1,24 SGS v. Pakistan*® and Impregilo v.
Pakistan,”° Bayindir argues in substance that

"A breach of the Contract [ ... ] is not a necessary precondition for this
Tribunal to find that Respondent violated its Treaty obligations; these are
independent inquiries. What Claimant must establish, and has established
here, is one or more violations by Respondent of its Treaty obligations."

PHB [Bay.] ¥7:

Pursuant to Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (hereafter, VCLT), done
at Vienna on 23 May 1969 (UN Treaty Series, vol. 1155, p. 331): "Unless a different intention
appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation
to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the
entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party." Article 13 of the ILC Articles states a
similar principle in the following terms: "An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an
international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act
occurs.”

In contrast, Pakistan argues that "it is not the role of this Tribunal (as it has rightly
reminded the Parties) to substitute itself for the contractual tribunal to which Bayindir
could have taken its case against NHA" (PHB [Pak.] 4 1.4). However, it asserts that

"a breach of Contract by the NHA is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition of
a breach of the BIT. In the absence of a breach of Contract there cannot be a
breach of the Treaty in this case [ ... ] It is a well-established proposition that a
breach of Contract by the State is not in itself a breach of international law. That
is still more true when one looks at a breach of Contract not by a State, but by a
State agency such as the NHA [ ... ] They have got to show more than just an
ordinary breach of Contract.”

(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 164-166: 18-22, 15-20, 6-7).

As a threshold matter, the Tribunal recalls that its jurisdiction covers treaty and not
contract claims. This does not mean that it cannot consider contract matters. It can
and must do so to the extent necessary to rule on the treaty claims. It takes contract
matters, including the contract's governing municipal law, into account as facts as far
as they are relevant to the outcome of the treaty claims. Doing so, it exercises treaty
not contract jurisdiction.

This approach is in conformity with international law’ and arbitral practice. As noted
by the ad hoc Committee in Vivendi v. Argentina, in assessing whether there has been
a treaty breach a tribunal may review contract matters "at least so far as necessary in
order to determine whether there had been a breach of the substantive standards of
the BIT,"*? adding that "it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction [ ... ] and

another to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has

29

been a breach of a distinct standard of international law. This approach was

confirmed in Vivendi Il:

"the Tribunal would not be applying the contract by deciding a contractual issue,
determining the parties’ respective rights and obligations or granting relief under
the agreement. It would be doing no more than the Respondent concedes is its

In Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, the Permanent Court of International
Justice observed: "It might be asked whether a difficulty does not arise from the fact that the
Court would have to deal with the Polish law of July 14, 1920. This, however, does not appear
to be the case. From the standpoint of International Law and of the Court which is its organ,
municipal laws are merely facts which express the will and constitute the activities of States, in
the same manner as do legal decisions or administrative measures. The Court is certainly not
called upon to interpret the Polish law as such; but there is nothing to prevent the Court's giving
judgment on the question whether or not, in applying that law, Poland is acting in conformity
with its obligations towards Germany under the Geneva Convention." PClJ, The Merits,

right — ie, taking the contractual background into account in determining
whether or not a breach of the Treaty has occurred. ns

These considerations do not imply that the assessment of a treaty breach in the
context of a contractual relationship requires a determination that the contract has been
breached. Breach of contract and breach of treaty are separate questions giving rise to
separate inquiries. Or in the words of the ad hoc Committee in Vivendi v. Argentina:

"whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a
breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be
determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law in the case of the
BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper
law of the contract.”*"

And in the same vein, Impregilo v. Pakistan:

"[T]he fact that a breach may give rise to a contract claim does not mean that it
cannot also — and separately — give rise to a treaty claim. Even if the two
perfectly coincide, they remain analytically distinct, and necessarily require
different enquiries.’ 92

Or in the words of the tribunal in Duke Energy:

"[I]n and of itself the violation of a contract does not amount to the violation of a
treaty. This is only natural since treaty and contract breaches are different things,
responding to different tests, subject to different rules."**

Because the enquiries are different, the fact that a State exercises a contract right
or remedy does not in and of itself exclude the possibility of a treaty breach.“ The
ad hoc Committee in Vivendi v. Argentina stressed this consequence in the
following words:

"[T]he passage [which concluded that it was impossible to separate the
analysis of treaty breaches from that of contract breaches] appears to imply
that conduct of Tucuman carried out in the purported exercise of its rights as
a party to the Concession Contract could not, a priori, have breached the
BIT. However, there is no basis for such an assumption: whether particular
conduct involves a breach of a treaty is not determined by asking whether
the conduct purportedly involves an exercise of contractual rights."

In conclusion, the Tribunal will take contract matters into account in its
determination of whether the Respondent has breached the Treaty whenever
relevant, while noting that a breach of contract is neither a necessary nor a sufficient
condition for a breach of treaty.

Burden of proof

The Parties concur that the burden of proving treaty breaches lies upon Bayindir (PHB
[Bay.] { 7, PHB [Pak.] 4 1.5). They disagree, however, on the relevant standards.

The Claimant refers to the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Corfu
Channel Case® in support of a liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial
evidence when such inferences are based "on a series of facts linked together and
leading logically to a single conclusion" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 107, 5-7). It submits this

 

argument particularly with regard to the absence from the record of minutes of the
meeting with General Musharraf on 12 April 2001, at which, according to the Claimant,
the "political decision was made to get rid of Bayindir" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 107, 14-

 

15). By contrast, the Respondent replies that the standard of proof is a demanding one
for certain issues, noticeably conspiracy. It also finds that no adverse influence can be
drawn from the lack of minutes of the meeting just referred to, in light of the Claimant's
allegations of bad faith as well as of its own failure to disclose internal documents.

The Tribunal notes that, in its reference to the Corfu Channel case, the Claimant has
omitted to mention that the Court expressly held that "proof may be drawn from
inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt."*” Hence,
the Tribunal will have to assess whether or not the evidence produced by the Claimant
is sufficient to exclude any reasonable doubt.

147.

The Tribunal further considers that, as argued by the Respondent, the standard for
proving bad faith is a demanding one, in particular if bad faith is to be established on
the basis of circumstantial evidence.

The relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards

In support of their positions, both Parties have relied extensively on previous ICSID
decisions and awards, either to conclude that the same solutions should be adopted in
the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from a certain
solution.

The Tribunal is not bound by previous decisions of ICSID tribunals. At the same time,
it is of the opinion that it should pay due regard to earlier decisions of such tribunals.
The Tribunal is further of the view that, unless there are compelling reasons to the
contrary, it ought to follow solutions established in a series of consistent cases,
comparable to the case at hand, but subject of course to the specifics of a given treaty
and of the circumstances of the actual case. By doing so, it will meet its duty to seek to
contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the
legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of
the rule of law.°°

Fair AND EQuITABLE TREATMENT

Bayindir's allegations of the many acts supporting its FET claim are loosely organized
and have undergone significant variations throughout the proceedings. To structure its
analysis, the Tribunal has sought to organize the earlier allegations within the
framework adopted in Bayindir's post-hearing brief. It is aware that such choice may
entail some repetition.

After discussing the admissibility of the importation of an FET obligation by operation of
the MFN clause (a), the identification of the relevant FET obligation (b), and the content

of the applicable standard (c), the Tribunal will analyze the Respondent's conduct
which led to the expulsion of Bayindir (d), followed by the expulsion of Bayindir (e), and
aimed at encashing the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees (f), as well as the
characterization of all these acts taken together (g).

Importation of FET obligation by operation of MFN clause

Bayindir’s position

The Claimant argues in essence that, despite the absence of a specific clause in the
Treaty providing for fair and equitable treatment, an FET obligation can be derived both
from the fourth paragraph of the preamble of the Treaty and from the operation of the
MEN clause in Article II(2) of the Treaty (Mem. M., 4.142). In this latter respect, the
Claimant seeks to import through Article II(2) of the Treaty the provisions on fair and
equitable treatment contained in the bilateral investment treaties ("BITs" or, individually
"BIT") concluded by Pakistan with France, the Netherlands, China, Australia,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom. At the hearing on the merits, Bayindir added a
reference to the BITs concluded by Pakistan with Lebanon, Sri Lanka and Denmark
(Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 92, 9-13). It refers more particularly to the FET provision in the
BIT between Pakistan and the United Kingdom“ ("Pakistan-UK BIT") (Reply M.
255).

 

The Claimant emphasizes that the interpretation of the Treaty's MFN clause supports
the importation of an FET guarantee in the light of (i) the Treaty's preamble and of its
object and purpose, as directed by Article 31 of the VCLT; (ii) Article II(4) of the Treaty,
which deliberately excludes some matters from the scope of operation of the MFN
clause and, a contrario, implies that matters not excluded such as FET are covered;
and (iii) the decisions in MTD v. Chile*’ (Mem. M.. 4145), Plama v. Bulgaria” and
Salini v. Jordan,® which, in Claimant's submission, make it clear that the specific

Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government

purpose of an MFN clause in a BIT is to "allow an investor to benefit from a more
favourable substantive protection of another Treaty" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 92, 15-17).

 

Pakistan's position

The Respondent argues that reliance on the MFN clause of the Treaty to import an
FET clause from another BIT is only possible if it is not excluded by the intention of the
contracting parties at the time of signing the Treaty. In the present case, the intention
had clearly been to exclude the FET standard to the extent that Turkey and Pakistan
deliberately decided not to include an FET clause in the Treaty "notwithstanding that
the preamble acknowledges the importance of fair and equitable treatment and clauses
requiring such treatment [ ... ] were already common by 1995 when the Pakistan-
Turkey BIT was signed" (Rej. M., 4.4.7).

With respect to the Pakistan-UK BIT to which Claimant makes special reference, the
Respondent noted at the hearing that the Claimant's interpretation would mean that the
decision of Pakistan and Turkey not to include an FET guarantee, while including an
MEN clause, would have had no effect at all, given that the Pakistan-UK BIT was
already in force (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 299, 1-12).

According to Pakistan, the Claimant's argument would amount to "precisely the kind of
‘treaty shopping’ against which the tribunals in cases like Maffezini and Telenor
warned, albeit in the context of substantive, rather than jurisdictional, provisions" (Rej.
M., (4.14).

Tribunal's determination

In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal noted that, in the absence of a specific
provision in the Treaty, it was doubtful that the sole text of the preamble would provide
a sufficient basis for a self-standing FET obligation.“ Prima facie for the sole purpose
of jurisdiction, it then considered that through the operation of Article II(2) of the Treaty
Bayindir could rely on Pakistan's obligation to act in a fair and equitable manner“®
contained in other BITs concluded by Pakistan. The Tribunal must now assess

Decision on Jurisdiction, § 230.
Id., (230-232.

42

154.

156.

157.

whether or not the prima facie applicability of an FET obligation can be confirmed in the
light of the submissions of the Parties on the merits.

The relevant passage of the preamble reads as follows:

"Agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in
order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective
utilization of economic resources." (Exh. [Bay.] B-33).

In the Tribunal's view, such language is of little assistance as it does not establish any
operative obligation. It is true that the reference to FET in the preamble together with
the absence of a FET clause in the Treaty might suggest that Turkey and Pakistan
intended not to include an FET obligation in the Treaty. The Tribunal is, however, not
persuaded that this suggestion rules out the possibility of importing an FET obligation
through the MFN clause expressly included in the Treaty. The fact that the States
parties to the Treaty clearly contemplated the importance of the FET rather suggests
the contrary. Indeed, even though it does not establish an operative obligation, the
preamble is relevant for the interpretation of the MFN clause in its context and in the
light of the Treaty's object and purpose pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT.

Article II(2) of the Treaty reads in relevant part as follows:

“Each Party shall accord to these investments, once established, treatment no less
favourable than that accorded in similar situations to investments of its investors or
to investments of investors of any third country, whichever is the most favourable."

(Exh. [Bay.] B-33)

This provision is limited by Article II(4) as follows:

"The provisions of this Article shall have no effect in relation to following

agreements entered into by either of the Parties;

(a) relating to any existing or future customs unions, regional economic
organization or similar international agreements,

(b) relating wholly or mainly to taxation."

(Exh. [Bay.] B-33)

The ordinary meaning of the words used in Article II(2) together with the limitations
provided in Article II(4) show that the parties to the Treaty did not intend to exclude the
importation of a more favourable substantive standard of treatment accorded to
investors of third countries. This reading is supported by the preamble's insistence on
FET.

43

158.

159.

161.

It is further supported by the decision of the tribunal in MTD v. Chile regarding the
application of MFN to import an FET obligation:

"The Tribunal has concluded that, under the BIT, the fair and equitable standard
of treatment has to be interpreted in the manner most conducive to fulfill the
objective of the BIT to protect investments and create conditions favorable to
investments. The Tribunal considers that to include as part of the protections of
the BIT those included in Article 3(1) of the Denmark BIT and Article 3(3) and (4)
of the Croatia BIT is in consonance with this purpose. The Tribunal is further
convinced of this conclusion by the fact that the exclusions in the MFN clause
relate to tax treatment and regional cooperation, matters alien to the BIT but that,
because of the general nature of the MFN clause, the Contracting Parties
considered it prudent to exclude. A contrario sensu, other matters that can be
construed to be part of the fair and equitable treatment of investors would be
covered by the clause."*°

The fact that there is no uniform case law on MFN and procedural rights and that
certain decisions, including Maffezini v. Spain and Telenor v. Hungary referred to by
the Respondent, as well as Plama v. Bulgaria and Salini v. Jordan, have adopted a
different view than the one applied here is of little relevance. Indeed, the ejusdem
generis principle that is sometimes viewed as a bar to the operation of the MFN clause
with respect to procedural rights does not come into play here and the words of the
Treaty are clear.

As noted by the Respondent, the FET provision to which the Claimant more specifically
referred, namely Article II(2) of the Pakistan-UK BIT, pre-dates the MFN clause in the
Treaty. In and of itself that chronology does not appear to preclude the importation of
an FET obligation from another BIT concluded by the Respondent. In any event, the
Claimant has also referred to BITs concluded subsequently to the Treaty. The issue is
therefore not whether the Claimant can invoke an FET obligation, but rather which one.

Identification of the FET obligation
Bayindir’s position

The Claimant refers more specifically to Article II(2) of the Pakistan-UK BIT, according
to which

"Investment of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall at all times
be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security
in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any

MTD v. Chile, supra footnote 18, § 104.

44

162.

163.

164.

way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory.""”
(Reply M., $255)

It has also pointed to the FET provisions included in the BITs concluded by Pakistan
with France, the Netherlands, China, Australia, Switzerland, Lebanon, Sri Lanka and
Denmark.

Pakistan's position

As discussed above, Pakistan objects to importing Article II(2) of the Pakistan-UK BIT
into the Treaty, arguing that the Pakistan-UK BIT pre-dates the Treaty and, therefore,
Turkey and Pakistan could not have intended to include that FET obligation into the
Treaty.

Tribunal's determination

In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal noted that Pakistan had not disputed that
the BITs concluded by Pakistan with France, the Netherlands, China, the United
Kingdom, Australia and Switzerland contained an explicit fair and equitable treatment
clause.“® At the hearing, Bayindir further referred to the BITs between Pakistan and
Lebanon, Sri Lanka and Denmark. The Respondent has not specifically disputed this
reference, focusing instead on the applicability of the FET provision of the Pakistan-UK
BIT.

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the basis for importing an FET obligation into the
Treaty is provided by its MFN clause, from which it follows that the applicable FET
standard is a self-standing treaty obligation as opposed to the customary international
minimum standard to which the Respondent referred. That being so, whether
international customary law and the observations of other tribunals in applying the
minimum standard may be relevant here will depend upon the terms of the applicable
FET standard.

The Claimant incorrectly refers to this provision as Article Ill of the Pakistan-UK BIT (Reply M., §
255, footnote 550), whereas the text cited by the Claimant corresponds to Article II(2) of said
BIT. Later in the proceedings, in its opening statement at the hearing on the merits, the
Claimant correctly referred to Article II(2) of said BIT (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 116, 5-7).

Decision on Jurisdiction, 231.

45

166.

167.

The Claimant has especially referred to Article II(2) of the Pakistan-UK BIT, quoted
above. It has also referred to Article 4 of the Agreement between the Swiss
Confederation and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan concerning the promotion and the
reciprocal protection of investments ("Pakistan-Switzerland BIT"),“° which was
concluded more than three months after its Turkish counterpart. In relevant part, the
Pakistan-Switzerland BIT provides as follows:

"(1) Each Contracting Party shall protect within its territory the investments made in
accordance with its laws and regulations by investors from the other Contracting
Party and shall not hinder through unjustified or discriminatory measures the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, accrual, sale and, as the case may
be, liquidation of such investments [ ...

(2) Each Contracting Party shall grant within its territory fair and, equitable
treatment to investments of investors from the other Contracting Party." *

(Exh. [Bay.] CLEX-18.11)

A comparison between Article II(2) of the Pakistan-UK BIT and Article 4 of the
Pakistan-Switzerland BIT suggests that the FET protection offered by these two
provisions is very similar. There is a difference, however, between the two treaties in
terms of chronology. The Pakistan-UK BIT was concluded before and the Pakistan-
Switzerland BIT after the Treaty. This difference matters in connection with the
Respondent's objection that, when they concluded the Treaty, Turkey and Pakistan
cannot have intended to include an FET clause such as the one in the Pakistan-UK BIT
or else they would have inserted an express provision. That argument only applies to
clauses that pre-date the conclusion of the Treaty. It does not apply to Article 4 of the
Pakistan-Switzerland BIT which was concluded after the Treaty. The fact that the latter
entered into force thereafter is irrelevant to ascertain the intention of the State parties
at the time of conclusion. As a result, the Tribunal cannot follow Respondent's
chronological objection.

Hence, by virtue both of the time of its conclusion and its close similarity to Article II(2)
of the Pakistan-UK BIT, Article 4 of the Pakistan-Switzerland BIT can be used as the

Concluded on 11 July 1995 and entered into force on 6 May 1996.

applicable FET standard in the present case. This said, a similar result would be
reached by applying Articles 2(2) and 3(1) of the Pakistan-Denmark BIT of 18 July
1996.

Content of the FET standard

Bayindir's position

It is Bayindir's submission that the applicable FET standard is based on a treaty and is
therefore not limited to the minimum standard under customary international law (Reply
M., (9257-280):

"Article II(2) of the UK-Pakistan BIT contains no such limitation, either on its face
or in substance. Nor do any of the other Pakistan BITs that | have just mentioned
[with Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Australia and Denmark]."

(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 116, 19-22)

With reference to PSEG v. Turkey,” it adds that the applicable FET standard is "a free-
standing obligation which does not depend for its meaning on the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 94, 5-8).

 

Regarding the content of the applicable standard of fair and equitable treatment, the
Claimant has submitted that

"Fair and equitable treatment [ ... ] includes a number of component principles,
including, the provision of a stable framework for the investment; refraining from
arbitrary and discriminatory conduct; providing transparency and due process;
acting in good faith; providing security for reasonable investment-backed
expectations and refraining from harassment, intimidation and coercion of the

investor.”
(Mem. M., 7148)

In reliance on Tecmed, Bayindir further submits that the FET standard protects the
basic expectations taken into account by a foreign investor in making the investment,
and requires the State to act in a "consistent and transparent manner so that the
investor can adapt to comply with shifts in Government policies" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008.
119, 1-3) and "to maintain a stable framework for investment" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008
119, 3-5). Tecmed v. Mexico defines the components of FET as follows:

"[tlo provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic
expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the
investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent
manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the
foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations
that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and
administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply
with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria
should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the
resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such
regulations. The foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently,
i.e., without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the
State that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as
to plan and launch its commercial and business activities. The investor also
expects the State to use the legal instruments that govern the actions of the
investor or the investment in conformity with the function usually assigned to such
instruments, and not to deprive the investor of its investment without the required
compensation."**

The Claimant also relies in particular on Saluka v. The Czech Republic, Eureko v.
Poland,®° and Victor Pey Casado v. Chile®® to submit that the unreasonable frustration
of an investor's good faith efforts to solve a problem may amount to a breach of the
FET standard, particularly when such frustration involves discriminatory action in favour
of host State nationals (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 119-120, 16-25, 1: 4 June 2008. 96, 4-
iz).

Finally, Bayindir contends that unfair and inequitable treatment does not need to be
identified "on the basis of individual or isolated acts" (Mem. M., { 149), but that the
Tribunal must appreciate whether "in all the circumstances the conduct in issue is fair
and equitable or unfair and inequitable" (Mem. M., 4 149). It refers in this regard to
Desert Line v. Yemen*” (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 120, 2-8).

Pakistan's position

Pakistan submits that even if the FET provision in the Pakistan-UK BIT were to be
applied, the content of such provision is linked to the existing standards of customary
international law (Tr. M.. 26 May 2008, 300-301, 16-25, 1-3). It refers in particular to
Siemens v. Argentina,*® which "says that one has to look for the content of that
standard in international law" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008. 303, 20-22).

Moreover, it is Pakistan's submission that the content of the applicable FET standard
should be assessed not by reference to the Tecmed case, which is controversial and
concerned a different situation, but rather by reference to Thunderbird v. Mexico,°°
which stands for the proposition that "the threshold [for a breach of FET] remains a
high one" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 303, 18-19). It adds that Tecmed does not provide an
authoritative statement of the general content of the FET standard and must be
regarded as "the high watermark of one particular view of fair and equitable treatment"
(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 302, 23-25). It also challenges its relevance as it concerned a
different situation.

Furthermore, Pakistan submits, following Mondev v. United States® and ADF v. United
States,*' that the Tribunal may not adopt its own idiosyncratic standard of what is fair or
equitable without reference to established sources of law, as Bayindir seems to imply
(Rej. M., 994.44 — 4.46).

Tribunal's determination

As an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that Article 4 of the Pakistan-Switzerland BIT
makes no reference to general international law. However, as already mentioned,
customary international law and decisions of other tribunals may assist in the

Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8) (hereafter, Siemens v.
Argentina), Award of 6 February 2007.

179.

interpretation of this provision. This is particularly apposite here given that Article 4(2)
of the Pakistan-Switzerland BIT simply states a general obligation of fair and equitable
treatment. The Tribunal must therefore set forth the meaning of such a general
obligation.

In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal stated by reference to Tecmed v. Mexico
that it could not rule out prima facie that Pakistan's fair and equitable treatment
obligation comprised an obligation to maintain a stable framework for investments™
and that "a State can breach the 'stability limb’ of its [FET] obligation through acts
which do not concern the regulatory framework but more generally the State's policy

n63

towards investments. It must now define the contours of the FET standards for

purposes of the merits.

The Tribunal agrees with Bayindir when it identifies the different factors which emerge
from decisions of investment tribunals as forming part of the FET standard. These
comprise the obligation to act transparently and grant due process,” to refrain from
taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures,® from exercising coercion® or from
frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework
affecting the investment.”

The Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that the Tecmed case lays out a broad
conception of the FET standard. Yet, it notes that the decision of the tribunal in
Thunderbird, to which the Respondent refers, speaks of the Tecmed decision as an
"authoritative precedent" with respect to the doctrine of legitimate expectations.®
Similarly, the decision in Siemens v. Argentina, also cited by the Respondent, relies on

Tecmed in its discussion of the contents of the FET standard. More recently, relying
in part upon Tecmed, the tribunal in Duke Energy v. Ecuador stressed that the
investor's expectations are an important element of FET, while at the same time
emphasizing their limitations:

"The stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the
investor's justified expectations. The Tribunal acknowledges that such
expectations are an important element of fair and equitable treatment. At the same
time, it is mindful of their limitations. To be protected, the investor's expectations
must be legitimate and reasonable at the time when the investor makes the
investment. The assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into
account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the investment,
but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in
the host State. In addition, such expectations must arise from the conditions that
the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon them when
deciding to invest."””

Furthermore, because a treaty breach is different from a contract violation, the Tribunal
considers that the Claimant must establish a breach different in nature from a simple
contract violation, in other words one which the State commits in the exercise of its
sovereign power. This view is consistent with a line of cases including RFCC v.
Morocco,”' Waste Management,” Impregilo v. Pakistan,” and Duke Energy v.
Ecuador, “ even though other tribunals have been less demanding.’°

Finally, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that such a breach need not necessarily
arise out of individual isolated acts but can result from a series of circumstances, and
that it does not presuppose bad faith on the part of the State.”°

On the basis of the FET standard as defined above, the Tribunal will now examine the
disputed conduct of Pakistan before (d) and after the expulsion (e), as well as in
connection with the encashment of the Guarantees (f), or when all of the Respondent's
acts are considered together (g). In doing so, the Tribunal will bear in mind that "a
judgment of what is fair and equitable [...] must depend on the facts of the particular
case"”’ and that the standard "must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.””®

Conduct leading to the expulsion of Bayindir

The Tribunal will discuss in turn Bayindir's case relating to the frustration of its
reasonable expectations (i), the existence of a conspiracy to expel it (ii), undue
pressure and coercion (iii), and the lack of due process and procedural fairness (iv).

Were Bayindir's reasonable expectations frustrated?

Bayindir's position

The Claimant argues in essence that its reasonable expectations that the legal
framework affecting its investment would remain stable and that the Respondent would
cooperate in resolving any issues that could arise under the Contract were based "on a
clearly perceptible and transparent legal framework and on undertakings and
representations made explicitly or implicitly by Pakistan” (Mem. M., 4 157), and that
these expectations were frustrated particularly after General Musharraf came to power
in October 1999.

The Claimant submits that since 1993, its investment was exposed to the "vagaries of
changing political winds in Pakistan" experiencing "several drastic changes of direction"
(Mem. M., { 145). It explains that when the Project was revived in 1997, the then
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif "repeated assurances of Pakistan's commitment to the
project" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 14, 20-23). It also puts forward Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's continued interest and support for the Project in February 1999, at a time when
the Respondent was allegedly having financial difficulties in pursuing the Project (Ir.
M., 26 May 2008, 20, 4-17).

Waste Management v. Mexico, supra footnote 65, § 99.

52

187.

189.

190.

According to Bayindir, such assurances were frustrated when General Musharraf came
to power:

"[Als soon as General Musharraf came to power, Pakistan seriously considered
terminating Bayindir's Contract. The solution the Committee settled upon in
November 1999 was to reduce the scope of the Project in view of financial
difficulties." (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 25, 16-21).

Months later, when Bayindir agreed to Addendum No. 9 in April 2000, it was only
because it believed that "with the signing of Addendum 9, Pakistan had made a serious
commitment to the M-1 Project, commitment that the M-1 Project would move forward
unhindered" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 30, 15-18). Later, as the Respondent encountered
further financial problems, Bayindir claims to have had a legitimate expectation "that
Pakistan would continue to support Bayindir's investment, working collaboratively to
page [sic] reasonable adjustments" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 123, 1-3).

Pakistan’s position

The Respondent acknowledges that legitimate expectations are protected by the FET
standard but refers to the decision of the ad hoc Committee in MTD v. Chile, pursuant
to which such expectations "are not a substitute for the language of the Treaty itself"
(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 304, 15-17).

In reliance on Aminoil,”® it also contends that in the context of an investment
agreement, it is above all the text of the Contract itself which embodies the legitimate
expectations of the Parties and that the Claimant could not reasonably expect that the
terms of the Contract would not be enforced (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 305-305, 4 June
2008, 166, 16-25).

 

Tribunal's determination

The Tribunal must first determine the relevant time for the formation of the investor's
expectations. Several awards have stressed that the expectations to be taken into
account are those existing at the time when the investor made the decision to invest.®°

Company (AMINOIL) (hereafter, Kuwait v. Aminoil), Award of 24 March 1982, 21 ILM 1982, pp.
976 — 1053.

Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador (hereafter, Occidental v. Ecuador), LCIA Case

53

191.

192.

194.

There is no reason not to follow this view here. The result is that the expectations to be
taken into account are those of the Claimant at the time of the revival of the Contract in
July 1997. The Tribunal chooses this time as opposed to an earlier one, because the
issues relating to the termination of the 1993 Contract had been settled, as the
Claimant acknowledged in its Request for Arbitration (RA. 4 8). The revival of the
Contract can thus be viewed as a new start. Moreover, at the hearing on the merits,
the Claimant put particular emphasis on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's expressions of
interest made at this same period (Ir. M., 26 May 2008, 14, 20-24).

A second question concerns the circumstances that the Tribunal must take into
account in analyzing the reasonableness or legitimacy of Bayindir's expectations at the
time of the revival of the Contract. In doing so, it finds guidance in prior decisions
including Saluka,*' Generation Ukraine® and Duke Energy v. Ecuador quoted above,
which relied on “all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the
investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions
prevailing in the host State."®*

In the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant could not reasonably
have ignored the volatility of the political conditions prevailing in Pakistan at the time it
agreed to the revival of the Contract. Indeed, the Claimant expressly acknowledges
that it suffered severely from political changes in Pakistan during the preceding years
(PHB [Bay.] 135-38).

In its submissions, the Claimant acknowledges that it was well aware of the potentially
adverse impact of a change in government. It specifically refers to the fact that, after
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was forced to resign in 1993, the new government
adopted a position opposed to the Project and decided to terminate it under Clause 74
of the 1993 Contract (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 14, 1-13; PHB [Bay.] 437). The Claimant
further notes that: "[i]n 1997, winds shifted again, and Nawaz Sharif returned to power.

He immediately resurrected the M-1 Project" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 14, 14-16).
According to the Claimant, Mr. Sharif gave "repeated assurances of Pakistan's
commitment to the project" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 14, 20-23) based on which the
Claimant agreed to enter into the Contract. However, in the light of the foregoing
circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Bayindir could not ignore the fact that the
future of the Project was linked to the shifts then affecting Pakistan's politics as well as
to the position of Mr. Sharif. Bayindir entered into the Contract in full knowledge of
these circumstances. It appears difficult to now accept that Bayindir had wider
expectations of stability and predictability so as to justify protection under the FET
standard.

When in 1999 General Musharraf took power in Pakistan, the political volatility
prevailing in Pakistan was again manifest. The Claimant nevertheless chose to
conclude Addendum No. 9 on 17 April 2000, although it argues in these proceedings
that the government of General Musharraf was hostile to the continuation of the
Project. Whether this latter assertion is sufficiently established is a matter that the
Tribunal will consider later. For the purposes of the present assessment, the
conclusion of Addendum No. 9 is another illustration of the fact that the Claimant
elected to pursue its activities in Pakistan despite a degree of political volatility of which
it was fully aware.

At the hearing on the merits, the Claimant asserted however that

"Bayindir believed that with the signing of Addendum 9, Pakistan had made a
serious commitment to the M-1 Project, commitment that the M-1 Project would
move forward unhindered.”

(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 30, 14-18)

In the opinion of the Tribunal, this latter allegation, even if proved, would not be
sufficient to establish a breach of the Respondent's obligation not to frustrate the
legitimate expectations of investors. As already noted, in the light of the political
changes of the preceding years, the Claimant could not reasonably expect that no
further political changes would occur. Moreover, in the present context of a contractual
relationship between Bayindir and the NHA, as the Respondent rightly stresses, the
expectations of the Claimant are largely shaped by the contractual relationship
between the Claimant and NHA. In this connection, there was no basis for the
Claimant to expect that NHA would not avail itself of its contractual rights. Although the

55

198.

(ii)

200.

201.

202.

Tribunal has no jurisdiction to assess whether there has been a breach of the Contract
under the Contract's proper law, the Tribunal must nevertheless take into account the
terms of the Contract as a factual element reflecting the expectations of the Claimant.
The allegations made by the Claimant in this regard are discussed by the Tribunal in
section |V(B)(b) to (e) below.

This conclusion does not imply that the events which led to the expulsion of the
Claimant were necessarily the result of a shift in political priorities. It is reached
irrespective of whether such a shift took place as a result of the assessment of the
Claimant's expectations as they stood well before the expulsion.

Therefore, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Bayindir's claim relating to the frustration
of its legitimate expectations cannot be sustained.

Bayindir's expulsion

The Claimant has sought to establish, first, that its expulsion was the result of a
conspiracy between different branches of the Pakistani government also involving the
Engineer and its Representative acting under the Contract (1), and, second, that such
expulsion was based on reasons unrelated to Bayindir's performance of the Contract,
namely changing political priorities, funding difficulties, a balance of payment crisis, and
conduct favouring local contractors (2).

These two contentions overlap to some extent, but not entirely, which is why the
Tribunal will deal with them separately.

Was there a conspiracy to expel Bayindir?

1.1 Bayindir's position

Bayindir contends that for reasons unrelated to its performance of the Contract (see
Reply M. 119), which will be discussed in the following section, the Respondent
conspired to misuse the provisions of the Contract in order to expel Bayindir. The
alleged conspiracy involved not only different divisions and officials of NHA and the
Pakistani government but also the Engineer and the Engineer's Representative (see

56

203.

204.

205.

Reply M., §. 55; Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 61, 12-17). In this respect, the Claimant has
particularly invoked the circumstances discussed in the following paragraphs.

First, Bayindir extensively refers to a "discussion paper" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 19, 24)

 

prepared by the then Joint Secretary of Communications, Mr. Ashraf Hayat, dated 14
October 2000 (Exh. [Bay.] CX-140). It focuses on the handwritten notes attributed to
the then Secretary of Communications, Mr. Nazar Shaikh, and approved by the then
Minister of Communications, General Qazi, saying:

"[als for M-1 Project, we should wait for any default by the Contractor and then
terminate the Project. They are likely to default in Burhan Section. NHA should
ensure not to default in any way and also not entertain requests for extension."

(Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 21, 3-8)

 

According to the Claimant, these handwritten notes evidence the existence of a
conspiracy to use the provisions of the Contract to expel Bayindir for reasons unrelated
to its performance. Based on the oral testimony of Mr. Shaikh, the Claimant submits
that the "discussion paper was prepared for the purposes of discussion, and was in fact
discussed, at an interministerial meeting held on 7 November 2000, chaired by the
Minister of Communications and attended by the Secretaries of Communications, the
Finance Division, the Planning and Development Division and including the Chairman
of NHA” (Tr. M.. 4 June 2008, 22-23, 24-25 and 1-5). Specifically, Bayindir contends
that the course of action manifested in the handwritten notes lay beneath the decision

 

taken at that meeting to continue with the Project but to bring any default of Bayindir to
the notice of the government (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 25, 2-12).

 

As a second circumstance evidencing conspiracy, Bayindir points to the preparation of
a milestone review meeting held on 19 March 2001. It notes that one day before the
meeting, the Chairman of NHA wrote to the Ministry of Communications and set out

"[E]xactly how the March 19 meeting would proceed. What the Engineer will say
about Bayindir, what the Engineer will say about NHA, how the limited Extension of
time will be announced, and how that extension will be made contingent upon the
extraction of a commitment from Bayindir.”

(Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 61, 19-20: see also Exh. [Bay.] CX-38).

Third, the Claimant submits that the decision to expel Bayindir was taken by General
Musharraf himself at the meeting held on 12 April 2001, specifically organized on the
request of General Qazi for this purpose. It considers that the steps followed thereafter
by the Chairman of NHA were intended to cover this reality and to suggest that the

57

207.

208.

expulsion decision had been made by the Chairman of NHA, among others, on the
basis of a brief legal opinion issued by Mr. Ebrahim on 23 April 2001 (Tr. M., 4 June
2008, 77-81).

 

 

As a fourth and related consideration, the Claimant asserts that the Engineer and
Engineer's Representative were involved in this conspiracy, and that such involvement
is what lies behind the unjustified treatment of requests for extension of time made by
Bayindir as well as the issuance of the notices under sub-clauses 46.1 and 63.1(b)(ii)
of the Contract.

Regarding the treatment of the requests for extension, Bayindir argues in essence that
the Engineer and Engineer's Representative eliminated and added work to Bayindir's
schedule in order to cause it to default on its obligations (Reply M.. | 56; see also CX-
134), that contrary to sub-clause 44.1 of the Contract they did not consult the
Contractor in the course of the evaluation of its requests for extension (EOT 01, 02),
nor did they share with Bayindir the evaluation report of EOT 03, and that they failed to
take into account that progress on the site was being prevented because of the
unavailability of land and not for lack of equipment. Bayindir further argues that the
evaluation of EOT 03 was orchestrated in preparation for the milestone review meeting
held on 19 March 2001 (Tr. M.. 4 June 2008, 43, 2-15 and 61, 12-17).

 

With respect to the issuance of the notice under sub-clause 46.1 of the Contract on 2
December 2000, Bayindir argues that there is no evidence on the record showing that
the Engineer formed his opinion in a reasonable, independent and professional
manner. Moreover, Bayindir further argues that the Engineer was instructed in a letter
of 16 November 2000® to issue a sub-clause 46.1 notice, despite the fact that Bayindir
had brought to the attention of the Engineer's Representative that its progress was
being obstructed by reasons that were not attributable to it and that a formal request for
extension would be submitted. Furthermore, the Claimant contends that as late as
September 2000, the Engineer's Representative had reached the conclusion that
Bayindir would find it difficult to complete the Priority Section 1 in time, but did not issue
a sub-clause 46.1 notice at the time, allegedly in order to make it more difficult for

In this regard, Claimant refers in paragraph 88 of its Reply on the merits to Exh. [Pak.] CM-23,
which appears to be unrelated to this allegation.

212.

Bayindir to react once the sub-clause 46.1 notice was actually issued in December
2000 (Reply M. 93-94).

Regarding the sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) notice, the Claimant essentially asserts that such
notice was improperly issued on the basis of an invalid sub-clause 46.1 notice. The
purpose of this latter notice is to alert the Contractor to the need to take measures to
meet the completion date. At the time of issuance of the sub-clause 46.1 notice,
Bayindir's construction activities on the site were in full swing (Exh. [Pak.] CM-14).
Bayindir argues that it did "proceed with the Works" and that a valid sub-clause
63.1(b)(ii) notice presupposes that the Contractor has stopped the works, as
recognized by Mr. Mirza in his letter to the Chairman of NHA (see Exh. [Bay.] CX-138)
and further confirmed by Mr. Pickavance, Bayindir's expert witness on construction

projects (Reply M.. {1 100-105).

Bayindir further suggests that the consultancy group of the Engineer, Pakistan
Motorways Consultants (PMC), was economically dependent upon Pakistan because
PMC's lead partner, ECIL, has undertaken 60 out of its 79 road sector projects for the
government of Pakistan (Reply M. 116-118). Moreover, in Bayindir's submission,
the correspondence between the Engineer and NHA with respect to Bayindir's request
EOT 04 suggests subservience of the Engineer to NHA (Reply M. 84-86). In
addition, a letter of 11 April 2001 from Mr. Mirza to NHA shows, according to Bayindir,
that Mr. Mirza, in his capacity as consultant, was sympathetic towards and privy to the
consideration of the various options by which Pakistan might save costs through action
adverse to the interests of Bayindir, including the suggestion that the best course of
action for Pakistan would be to terminate the Contract under clause 74.1, as invoking
63.1 was difficult to justify (Reply M., (| 107-111; CX-138).

1.2 Pakistan's position

The Respondent asserts that the allegation of conspiracy is without basis, and that it
has been advanced by the Claimant to meet the more demanding requirements of a
treaty breach, in what is in fact a contractual dispute:

"In the presentation of its case, Bayindir has always been acutely aware that, even
assuming in its favour that the Clause 63.1 notice was incorrectly issued, without
more, with NHA acting on the basis of that notice in expelling Bayindir, the remedy
for Bayindir lies under the Contract, in a challenge to a decision of the Engineer

59

213.

214.

215.

216.

and ultimately arbitration pursuant to Clause 67. It is only if the notice was issued
as part of a conspiracy, with the Engineer acting in bad faith with NHA and the
Government of Pakistan, that a claim for breach of the Treaty could have any
chance of success."

(PHB [Pak.] ¢ 2.3)

In Pakistan's view Bayindir's claim rests upon the allegations that President Musharraf
made a decision to expel Bayindir:

"Bayindir's case on conspiracy ultimately turns upon the allegation that a decision
to expel Bayindir was taken by the Chief Executive (President Musharraf) on 12
April 2001, and that this decision was then followed by the issue of a Clause 63.1
Certificate, which was allegedly issued in bad faith by the Engineer. That claim is
simply inconsistent with the documentary (as well as oral) evidence. Bayindir has
a high threshold to meet in terms of establishing the existence of a conspiracy. It
has failed to meet that threshold."

(PHB [Pak.] ¢ 2.4)

Pakistan further disputes Bayindir's assertion that the expulsion was decided for
reasons unrelated to the performance of the Contract. It claims that the circumstances
on which Bayindir relies are insufficient to establish the existence of a conspiracy and
are rebutted by the evidence. In particular, the Respondent puts forward the following
arguments.

First, Mr. Hayat's discussion paper of 14 October 2000 and the handwritten additions
made by Mr. Shaikh only reflect internal discussions and cannot be interpreted as
recording a decision or an instruction, and even less one aiming at the rejection of all
EOT requests, whether valid or not (PHB [Pak.] {1 2.14-2.17). Moreover, the minutes
of the interministerial meeting held on 7 November 2000 merely reflect the review of
“an important national infrastructure project, subject to substantial delays, and also
subject to particular criticisms from the World Bank and the Planning Commission"
(PHB [Pak.] { 2.20) and, in all events, the decision which ensued was that the project

could continue.

Second, the Respondent argues that, contrary to Bayindir's allegations, the minutes of
the milestone review of 19 March 2001 accurately reflect Pakistan's concern at
Bayindir's poor performance of the Contract, which is further confirmed by the
testimonies of General Javed and Mr. Bridger, and by the minutes of the Contract
Progress Meeting held ten days later, on 29 March 2001 (PHB [Pak. 2.35 and
2.39). Pakistan also points to Mr. Bridger's testimony that this meeting was a "turning

60

217.

218.

219.

220.

point" and that it was then that Mr. Bridger "lost patience with Bayindir" (PHB [Pak.]
2.35).

Third, with respect to the meeting with General Musharraf held on 12 April 2001 at the
request of General Qazi, Pakistan argues that "[t]he reason why the involvement of
President Musharraf was sought related to the particular sensitivities of Pakistan's
diplomatic relations with Turkey" (PHB [Pak. 2.48) and not because it was for
General Musharraf to take the final decision on the continuation of the Project.
Pakistan stresses that it was the Chairman of NHA who took the decision to expel
Bayindir. For that, he formed his judgment not only on the basis of the legal opinion
issued by Mr. Ebrahim on 23 April 2001, but also of the interim report of 7 April 2008 of
the expert group constituted by the Chairman of NHA in coordination with the World
Bank, as well as the letter to NHA of 11 April 2001 from Mr. Mirza, acting in his
capacity as consultant.

Fourth, regarding Bayindir's allegations of bad faith on the part of the Engineer and the
Engineer's Representative, Pakistan advances several arguments.

With respect to the treatment of the requests for extension, Mr. Shaikh explained that,
in his handwritten notes on Mr. Hayat's discussion paper, by "requests for extension,"
he meant negotiated extensions such as the one under Addendum No. 9, and not
extensions under the Contract, which were to be decided by the Engineer. Moreover,
the fact that in early 2001 both the Engineer and NHA approved an extension of time
for Bayindir in response to EOT 03 rules out Bayindir's allegation that a decision had
been made to reject any request for extension (Rej. M., 2.15). As far as EOT 01 and
EOT 02 are concerned, Mr. Bridger explained that they were not the subject of a formal
determination by the Engineer because all the issues raised by these requests were
agreed in Addendum No. 9 (Rej. M., 2.29). As for EOT 03, Pakistan argues that
Bayindir was indeed provided with an opportunity to explain its position at a formal
meeting (C-Mem. M., { 2.127) and that the installation of traffic signs was not essential
nor did it prevent the completion of the works (Rej. M., {1 2.34-2.39).

Further, Pakistan disputes having instructed the Engineer to issue a sub-clause 46.1
notice. The letter of 16 November 2000 referred to by Bayindir had nothing to do with

61

221.

222.

sub-clause 46.1. In fact, it demonstrates an instance in which the Engineer had ruled
against NHA within the framework of sub-clause 67.1. In addition, Bayindir
misinterprets Mr. Bridger's letter of 2 December 2000 allegedly acknowledging that
equipment productivity was obstructed by the large proportion of confined working
area. Contrary to Bayindir's interpretation, Mr. Bridger not only recommended an
increase of 10 to 20% in equipment, but also noted the need for an increase in
productivity because Bayindir was relying excessively on locally hired equipment which
was sub-standard and unreliable and had even reduced the number of pieces of
Bayindir-owned equipment between November 2000 and February 2001 (Rej. M.. 9
2.52-2.55).

With respect to the steps that led to the issuance of the sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) notice,
Pakistan argues that a sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) notice presupposes the issuance of a sub-
clause 46.1 notice and that Bayindir's interpretation of the words "to proceed with the
Works" in clause 63.1(b)(ii) is neither supported by the provisions of the Contract nor
by the practical realities of managing a large construction project (Rej. M.. 12.59). As
for Mr. Mirza's letter to NHA of 11 April 2001, Pakistan stresses that this letter was
written in Mr. Mirza's capacity as lead consultant to NHA rather than as Engineer, that
Bayindir was fully aware that the PMC group was acting as consultants to NHA, that
such double capacity is not uncommon and does not threaten impartiality, and that at
no time did such letter say that proceeding under sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) would not be
justified. In addition, Pakistan refers to Mr. Mirza's supplemental witness statement
confirming that the decision to issue a sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) notice was not taken as a
result of any pressure from NHA (Rej. M., {._ 2.66). Pakistan also notes in relation to
request for extension EOT 04, that it was not received until the Engineer issued the
sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) certification, and that such request had therefore no bearing on
the Engineer's determination.

Concerning Bayindir's allegation relating to the economic dependence of the
Engineer's consultancy group, Pakistan argues in reply that ECIL, PMC's lead partner,
does not depend upon any one agency and that employers such as NHA are
autonomous. In addition, Pakistan argues that ECIL is involved in a substantial
number of international projects and that the independence of the PMC group cannot

62

223.

224.

225.

226.

be assessed solely in the light of ECIL's position, to the extent that the group consists
of 5 firms, including an American and an Australian one (Rej. M. 2.71-2.74).

1.3. Tribunal's determination

At the outset, the Tribunal recalls that the standard for proving a conspiracy involving a
bad faith component is a demanding one.

The Claimant has referred to the award in Waste Management v. Mexico, which
defines conspiracy as "a conscious combination of various agencies of government
without justification to defeat the purposes of an investment agreement." The
Tribunal considers that this definition provides good guidance.

Mr. Nazal Shaikh's notes

In support of its allegation of conspiracy, the Claimant first points to the handwritten
notes (in particular those in paragraph 9, alternatively numbered as paragraph 273)
appearing at the end of Mr. Hayat's document dated 14 October 2000 (Exh. [Bay.] CX-
140). At the hearing, Mr. Hayat described this document as a "discussion paper" (Tr.
M., 28 May 2008, 148. 4). The "discussion paper" focuses on a critical assessment
made by the World Bank of the M-1 Project and discusses the advantages and
disadvantages of putting an end to the project. The document then proposes different
courses of action. The last page of the document contains handwritten notes attributed
to Mr. Nazar Shaikh, the then Secretary of Communications, which read in paragraph 9
(or 273) as follows:

"As for M-1 project, we should wait for any default by the contractor and then
terminate the project. They are likely to default in Burhan Section. NHA should
ensure not to default in any way and also not entertain requests for extension."

(Exh. [Bay.] CX-140)

While the Claimant's interpretation of these notes is prima facie understandable, the
witness testimonies did not support the thesis that the notes evidence a conspiracy. At
the hearing, Mr. Hayat recognized that there were internal divergences regarding the
desirability of the M-1 Project, which were discussed in his paper:
"| think that some perspective is necessary. This Project is being viewed by many
players as not a very good Project to have, and the discussion would not have

Waste Management v. Mexico, supra footnote 65, J 138.

63

227.

228.

229.

prolonged for as long as it did if it were being implemented quickly, but it was just
ridden with slow movement and difficulties, and was being, therefore, repeatedly
questioned. So, my view was that it was worth considering, because some players
think that it is a bad Project, to look at how this can be rationalised or reduced or
stopped, or whatever. That was my view. It was not a view to — it was nothing
more than that, and it was — and this was really a response to the World Bank's
assertion that this is not a good Project."

(Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 152-153, 12-25, 1).

The Tribunal does not see in such divergences, which are not an unusual occurrence
among administrations, evidence of a conspiracy. More importantly, the course of
action proposed in the handwritten notes cannot be viewed as reflecting either a final
decision or an instruction imposed on the Engineer. Indeed, Mr. Hayat testified as
follows:

"[I]f | may add, you see, this is an internal note, and it was not a decision, it was my
opinion, and it was not communicated to the NHA, | repeat, it was not
communicated to the NHA as a decision at all. So this really — it was just for our
internal consumption. How it got out and came in the hands of people who were
not authorized to look, that is a different question.”

(Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 249-250, 21-25, 1-4)

This conclusion is corroborated by the testimony of the former Minister of
Communications, General Qazi. The latter acknowledged that there were divergent
views among the different divisions of the Pakistani government concerned with the
Project. He stressed that Mr. Hayat's discussion paper had no impact on the
discussions held during the meeting of 7 November 2000, at which the course of action
described in paragraph 9 of the discussion paper would have allegedly been endorsed:

"This report was not discussed, because there were people from finance, there
were people from planning, and they were all expressing their views about the
Project, and they were asking me to take a decision, and | recorded my decision,
and my decision was; we will go ahead with the Project, and we will not take — we
will not make use of further loan from the Turkish Exim Bank, which was, extremely
expensive, because we would be able to fund the Project with our own money, and
| said, 'Make sure that the Project is completed on time and nobody defaults’, and |
expressed some — also caution about not compromising with the safety [ ... ]."

(Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 298. 7-19).

The minutes of the meeting held on 7 November 2000 further confirm this conclusion.
In effect, they record that the Minister of Communications decided inter alia that "[w]ork
on the project especially the two sections Islamabad-Burhan and Rashakai-Charsadda
may continue" (Exh. [Bay.] CX-201, { 5(i)).

64

230.

231.

Milestone review meeting of 19 March 2001

As a further circumstance, Bayindir claims that the milestone review meeting of 19
March 2001 was pre-orchestrated as part of the conspiracy. It relies on the note
signed by the Chairman of NHA dated 18 March 2001 (Exh. [Bay.] CX-38), which
discusses the strategy to be followed during the meeting of 19 March 2001 in
connection with a request for extension submitted by Bayindir. The note summarizes
the strategy by referring to the "slippages in progress," NHA's "stance to abide by our
part of the Contract" and its contractual remedies:

"5. [...] the undersigned will work on the following strategy with M/s Bayindir during
the meeting scheduled for tomorrow:-

a. The Engineer will highlight the slippages in progress despite provision of
all facilities including prompt payments by NHA. This will be in line with
our committed stance to abide by our part of the Contract Agreement.

b. The main grounds for Bayindir's extension are based on late availability
of construction site which, being untrue, will be strongly contested both
by the Engineer and NHA with facts and figures and photographs. The
grant of extension of 27 days will not be announced but will be made
contingent upon a commitment by M/s Bayindir to put their act together
and increase the progress substantially.

c. M/s Bayindir will be appropriately reminded of the rights and remedies
available to NHA in the event of non-fulfilment of their contractual
obligations, to which | have alluded in para. 3.

(Exh. [Bay.] CX-38, para. 5)

On the basis of the other elements in the record, the Tribunal reaches a different
understanding of this note from the Claimant. In reality, the Respondent had serious
concerns about Bayindir's performance. Paragraph 1 of the note records that despite
"numerous notices and reminders, both verbally and in writing [ ... ] the pace of work
did not pick up despite the scheduled completion date of priority sections by 23° March
2001 drawing closer" (Exh. [Bay.] CX-38, par. 1). Paragraph 2 adds that "M/s
Bayinder, as per their past practice, instead of gearing up their work, approached the
Turkish Embassy" (Exh. [Bay.] CX-38, par. 2). These concerns are corroborated by the
testimonies of General Javed and Mr. Bridger. At the hearing, General Javed testified
in this connection that:

"L...] we were paying them the state-of-the-arts rates, and one expected to see a
good quality of equipment. [...], their machine mix was wrong. They didn't have the
right equipment to do the job. Also, the sequencing was wrong. They didn't have a
good work cycle worked out, which meant that they were wasting their time with
their equipment."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 14-16)

65

232.

234.

Mr. Bridger, the Engineer's Representative, also stressed Bayindir's poor performance:

"| think by and large, the people in this room should understand that delays — there
was a very large area of this Project that | think we are talking about, around about
35 kilometres on Part 1, by and large the Contractor was way behind without any
cause of delay from external influences."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 189, 6-12)

While the Tribunal found the statements of these witnesses credible, it remained
unconvinced by the Claimant's representatives. Mr. Jilani, Bayindir's area manager,
who was most directly concerned with the development of the M-1 Project stated that
after 1999 issues of equipment and mobilisation were reported directly to Mr. Sadiq
Can “because he is, by profession, a Mechanical Engineer, so that is how the
construction was being managed" (Tr. M., 27 May 2008, 24, 3-7). As for Mr. Can, who
was serving at the time as President of the Bayindir Construction Company, his
testimony left the overall impression that the project was not being handled
professionally:

"Q: Your Project Manager, Mr. Yildirim, would he provide reports back to Ankara
and to Bayindir to Head Office about how the progress on the job was going, what
resources might be needed, what equipment, staffing levels, issues like that related
to a large Project, would he communicate with Head Office, or send periodic
reports to that effect?

A: Yes, We used to talk to him periodically. Sometimes it was every week,
sometimes | personally went to Pakistan, and | stayed there for a week or ten days,
and we were working on site with him. It was not in the form of written reports, but
we were in constant contact."

(Tr. M., 27 May 2008, 253-254, 15-25, 1-3)

The same impression arose from the examination of Mr. Jilani, Bayindir's area
manager, who was very hesitant when asked about basic aspects of the Project's
management, for instance whether he had signed Addendum No. 9 in April 2000,
which surprised the Tribunal knowing the importance of that document (Ir. M.. 27 May
2008, 60, 9-22).

The existence of real concerns over the performance of Bayindir is reinforced by the
minutes of the milestone review meeting (Exh. [Pak.] RB-68) and of the contract
progress meeting No. 32 held on 29 March 2001 (Exh. [Bay.] CX-153). For all these
reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence adduced by the Claimant does not
support the allegation that the milestone review meeting of 19 March 2001 was pre-
orchestrated as part of the conspiracy.

66

236.

237.

238.

239.

Meeting of 12 April 2001

As an additional element of conspiracy, Bayindir asserts that the decision to terminate
the Contract was taken by General Musharraf at the meeting held on 12 April 2001,
while presented as having been made by the Chairman of NHA at a later time. It is
true that there is evidence of the involvement of high officials of the Pakistani
government, including General Musharraf, in the assessment and follow up of the
Project. General Qazi, the Minister of Communications, confirmed this fact on cross-
examination:

"Q: You said a moment ago, if | am not mistaken, that if Bayindir would default, the
National Highway Council would decide whether to follow the contractual terms or
not. Do you mean that a decision to terminate the Contract would have to be taken
bit (sic) National Highway Council?

A: No, sir. That would be taken by the NHA. NHA is the contracting party. But
National Highway Council would only come in with regard to the matter of Turkey
being involved, you know, as | said, it weighed very heavily on us, because
previously once the Contract was terminated by a previous Government, the
Government of Turkey intervened. They did not do so this time, but still, that was
on our mind, and in any case, NHA council had to be kept informed about the
happenings, because that is the overall policy-making body. So if Bayindir default,
the NHA counsel had to be informed. The Chairman of the council had to be told,
and then whatever action there to be taken, whether it is termination, whether it is
extension, whether it is this, that, that is the job of the National Highway Authority.
That is not my job, or the Chief Executive's job, or anybody else's job.

(Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 315-319).

This appears unsurprising if not normal for a project of major economic importance for
the development of the country. It is certainly not an indication of a conspiracy to put
an end to the Contract without justification.

In fact, there is no direct evidence on record demonstrating that it was General
Musharraf who took the decision to terminate the Contract. There are no minutes of
the meeting of 12 April 2001, no other writings nor witness evidence. To the contrary,
General Qazi testified plausibly that General's Musharraf's involvement was limited to
the potential diplomatic repercussions of significant actions involving the M-1 Project.
This is consistent with the testimony of the then Secretary of Finance of Pakistan,
Mr. Afzal (Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 35, 6-11).

At the hearing, Bayindir argued that in the absence of direct evidence of the fact that
General Musharraf had taken "the political decision [ ... ] to get rid of Bayindir" (Tr. M., 4

 

67

240.

241.

242.

June 2008, 107, 14-15), such a conclusion could nevertheless be reached on the basis
of indirect evidence as "the whole series of facts, linked together, lead logically to that
single and inevitable conclusion" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 107, 15-17). The Tribunal
cannot follow Bayindir. It does not consider that the series of facts identified by the
Claimant and just discussed is sufficient to establish conspiracy.

Engineer's role in conspiracy

The Claimant's argument necessarily entails, not just that the Engineer and the
Engineer's Representative failed in their duties under the Contract, but that they were
in fact part of the conspiracy, and this is what the Claimant does allege. It questions
the conduct of the Engineer and the Engineer's Representative in connection with the
treatment of Bayindir's requests for extension, the issuance of a sub-clause 46.1
notice, and the issuance of a sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) notice. Although these are
contractual questions, the Tribunal will review them to the extent relevant for the
assessment of a breach of the Treaty.

The Engineer is appointed by the Employer (Part | - General Conditions — sub-clause
1.1(iv)). For certain matters, he must obtain the Employer's specific approval before
exercising his authority (Part | - General Conditions — sub-clause 2.1(b)). For others,
he is to exercise his discretion. In so doing, he must act "impartially within the terms of
the Contract and having regard to all the circumstances" (Part | —- General Conditions —
sub-clause 2(6)). The "Engineer's Representative" is appointed by and responsible to
the Engineer. He carries out the duties and exercises the authority delegated to him by
the Engineer (Part | - General Conditions — sub-clause 2.2).

Sub-clause 44.1 of the Contract provides the reasons and procedure for time
extensions:

"In the event of:

(a) the amount or nature of extra or additional work, or

(b) any cause of delay referred to in these Conditions, or

(c) exceptionally adverse climatic conditions, or

(d) any delay, impediment or prevention by the Employer, or

(e) other special circumstances which may occur, other than through a default of or
breach of contract by the Contractor or for which he is responsible,

being such as fairly to entitle the Contractor to an extension of the Time for
Completion of the Works, or any Section or part thereof, the Engineer shall, after
due consultation with the Employer and the Contractor, determine the amount of

68

243.

244.

245.

such extension and shall notify the Contractor accordingly, with a copy to the
Employer."

(Exh. [Bay.] C-10)
The Engineer or his Representative are required to obtain the written approval of the
Employer before deciding an extension of time under clause 44 above (Part Il —
Conditions of Particular Applications — sub-clause 2.1(e)). By contrast, the issuance of
notices under sub-clauses 46.1 and 63.1(b)(ii) are not subject to prior approval of the
Employer.

The Engineer's contractual status and the provisions governing requests for extension
being defined, the Tribunal first turns to EOT 03. At the hearing, the Claimant focused
on a number of additional works eliminated and added to its schedule, allegedly to
push it into default. It also claimed that the Engineer's Representative had failed to
investigate and take into account the obstruction by landowners, which would have
entitled the Claimant to a time extension.

The chronology with respect to EOT 03 is the following. On 15 January 2001, Bayindir
requested an extension on the ground of additional works and difficulties of access to
the site because of obstruction by land owners. On 22 February 2001, the Engineer
sent his evaluation report on EOT 03 to the Employer recommending inter alia an
extension of time of 49 days for the completion of Part |, Islamabad to Burhan Section,
out of 208 days requested (Exh. [Pak.] CM-88)]. By letter of 15 March 2001, the
Engineer's Representative informed Bayindir that EOT 03 had been evaluated and
forwarded to the Employer for approval. He drew Bayindir's attention to the fact that,
notwithstanding its request for extension, Bayindir's rate of progress had remained
"well below the Contract requirements" and it had therefore "failed to comply with the
requirements [of sub-clause 46.1]" (Exh. [Pak.] RB-58). On 17 March 2001, the
Engineer's Representative revised the recommendation for time extension previously
made and recommended an extension of 27 days for Part I, on the basis of further
discussions with the Engineer and of the consideration of the course of action that
Bayindir could follow (Exh. [Pak.] CM-96). On 2 April 2001, NHA approved the
extension recommended by the Engineer (Exh. [Pak.] CM-100), which the Engineer's
Representative communicated to Bayindir by letter of 3 April 2001 (Exh. [Pak.] CM-
101).

This sequence suggests that the examination by the Engineer and the Engineer's
Representative of EOT 03 followed the procedure set forth in sub-clause 44.1 of the
Contract. It is true that the reduction in the days recommended for extension from 49
to 27 days may appear surprising. Yet, Mr. Bridger gave the following
contemporaneous explanation:

"Following consultation on the Extension of Time Claim with NHA and the
Contractor and now having had further discussions with the Engineer, it is
considered that some minor changes are warranted only to the Part | time
extension consideration.

In Section 3.10 — Delays in Approval and Revision of Drawings, | note: (a) in
previous reference to the 4 cell culvert to be constructed under the Lunda Cut
Flyover, | now consider that it would have been possible to construct the Flyover
approach fill with only a pipe culvert installed initially and the 4-cell culvert
constructed later. This would remove the 4-cell culvert from any consideration in
the Extension of Time Claim. (b) the time for completing the rock excavation would
be 21 days rather than 28 days; this better reflects the Contractor's approved rate
of construction progress for this work. (c) that the main carriageway of the
Motorway could be opened to traffic once the Underpass at Km 32+510 has been
completed, and backfilled, the motorway pavement has been completed, the
Flyover bridge girders launched over the pavement and the deck slab formwork
fixed into position over the main carriageways."

(Exh. [Pak.] CM-96).

At the hearing, the Claimant challenged the explanation just quoted. Addressing some
of the obstacles that Bayindir had alleged in support of its request for time extension,
Mr. Bridger stressed that:

"| think that by and large, the people in this room should understand that delays —
there was a very large area of this Project that | think we are talking about, around
about 35 kilometers on Part 1, by and large the Contractor was way behind without
any cause of delay from external influences."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 189. 6-12)

Dealing specifically with the reduction of the extension eventually granted to Bayindir,
he added:

"By reverting to the Clause 14 programme production figures for rock excavation,
which | must say, in all of this Extension of Time analysis, we probably started off
being maybe a little on the generous side with the Contractor, but in discussions it
became obvious with NHA and the Contractor, it became obvious that we could
have tightened up on things, and this is certainly one of the outcomes. After
sending my letter to the Engineer, he didn't want to be caught out with another
change, and we discussed what was possible with the Clause 14 programme
production rates, and that is why this change came about."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 204-205, 24-25, 1-11)

Whatever the actual number of extension days to which Bayindir was entitled, the facts
just reviewed do not warrant a conclusion that the Engineer or Engineer's

70

251.

252.

Representative acted partially or conspired with the Employer or the Respondent. This
conclusion is confirmed by the observation that between November 2000 and July
2001, five out of ten decisions of the Engineer were in favour of Bayindir, and that three
of these prompted the Employer to file notices to commence arbitration (PHB [Pak.] {
6.25; Exh. [Pak.] CM-19 to CM-21, CM-24 to CM-26, CM-29 to CM-31, CM-33, CM-37
and CM-38).

This conclusion is more generally supported by Mr. Bridger's oral examination. He left
the impression of a serious professional, who may well have been irritated at times by
Bayindir's slow progress and other deficiencies, but who was perfectly aware of his
duties as the Engineer's Representative under the Contract. This said, it is true that
the Tribunal did not have the benefit of Mr. Mirza's testimony at the hearing. Yet, the
record shows that Mr. Mirza considerably relied upon Mr. Bridger who was the one
exercising the duties and authority of the Engineer. This was certainly so with respect
to the matters reviewed here.

The same considerations hold true for the other acts of the Engineer and the
Engineer's Representative which Bayindir challenges. Specifically, the Parties
disagreed on a number of issues relating to the issuance of the notices under sub-
clauses 46.1 and 63.1(b)(ii), particularly whether the completion dates for the Priority
Sections under Addendum No. 9 were binding; whether expulsion was available as a
remedy even after the imposition of liquidated damages under sub-clause 47.3 of the
Contract (as amended by Addendum No. 6); whether a sub-clause 46.1 notice could be
issued pending a request for extension of time; whether the content of the sub-clause
46.1 notice was specific enough for the Contractor to understand that it referred to the
completion dates of the Priority Sections; whether the issuance of a sub-clause
63.1(b)(ii) after a sub-clause 46.1 notice presupposes an almost complete stoppage of
the works.

In particular, the Parties have put forward competing interpretations of the meaning of
sub-clauses 46.1 and 63.1(b)(ii), which are the main contractual bases for the
expulsion of Bayindir. The notice under sub-clause 46.1 is indeed a precursor of the
notice under sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii), which in turn provides the basis for the expulsion of
the contractor. Yet, the Tribunal finds that the issuance of the notices under these sub-

71

253.

254.

clauses was based on a reasonable interpretation of the Contract, as evidenced by the
written (Bridger's WS. 72-73, 95-102; Bridger's supplemental WS. 48-71, 98-115)
and oral testimony of Mr. Bridger (Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 194-201). On cross-
examination, Mr. Bridger noted inter alia that:

"Q: Mr. Bridger, is the purpose of Clause 46.1, of a Notice under Clause 46.1 to
encourage the Contractor to expedite progress in order to bring the delayed Project
back on schedule?

A: That is, strictly speaking, the purpose of it. | think even if it is not absolutely
possible to bring it back on schedule, | think a reasonable client would be happy to
see efforts being made that would bring it back towards the schedule, and | think
the whole idea was to gear this Project up so that it wasn't going to be falling
behind the way it was falling behind.

Q: So a reasonable Contractor (sic) [client] would be happy to see that efforts were
being made to bring it behind schedule, and to bring it on schedule?

A: Substantial efforts, and real efforts. Not just bringing in equipment that didn't
have the capacity to achieve the production levels, you know, we saw a lot of
increases in equipment after that Notice was served, but the productivity fell,
despite the increase in numbers of items of equipment.”

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 192-193, 12-25, 1-8).

Mr. Bridger's understanding of the purpose of a sub-clause 46.1 notice was confirmed
by the Claimant's expert witness Mr. Pickavance, according to whom "the purpose of
Clause 46.1 is to draw the Contractor's attention to the fact that he is not proceeding
quickly enough in order to complete on time, and it is a precursor to the operation of
Clause 63(b)(ii) in certain circumstances" (Tr. M., 30 May 2008, 221, 10-16).
Mr. Pickavance opined however that the content of the notice was not precise enough,
as it did not specify which works needed to be accelerated. According to Mr.
Pickavance, "the Contractor has to tell the Engineer what he is going to do to put it
right, but he cannot tell him what he's going to do to put it right unless he knows what it
is that is wrong" (Tr. M., 30 May 2008, 221, 21-24). The experts produced by the
Respondent, Prof. Uff and Mr. Chapman, were not of the same opinion. For them,
“[t]he nature of the thing is to tell the Contractor he's going too slowly. It then requires
him to take steps which the Engineer has to approve" (Tr. M., 30 May 2008, 222. 10-
13) and "[w]hat would normally happen in the circumstance would be there would be a
meeting after the receipt of a letter like this, so that the Contractor could be made clear
at a meeting of the particular points where he needs to put more effort in" (Tr. M., 30
May 2008, 223, 13-18).

 

This discussion is particularly relevant when it comes to assessing Bayindir's reaction
to the sub-clause 46.1 notice. Mr. Bridger's view was that Bayindir failed to proceed

72

255.

256.

with the works and that the issuance of a sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) notice was thus
justified. Asked in cross-examination why he had not proceeded as in early 2000,
when before issuing such a notice he had alerted Bayindir, Mr. Bridger answered that
in April 2001 the situation was different:

"A: [ ... ] We had been through a lot of processes up to that point, including this

opportunity for dialogue, and so it was a different situation then.

Q: A different situation where, in your assessment, a dialogue would have been

counterproductive?

A: The dialogue had taken place the second time because with extensive dialogue

at the time of addendum number 9, and concessions had been made with respect

to the Mobilization Advance, retrieval of the Mobilization Advance by incremental

monthly payments, quite significant changes had been made to that [...]."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 226-227.

Bayindir's progress following the sub-clause 46.1 notice and whether it justified a sub-
clause 63.1(b)(ii) notice was debated by the experts. Mr. Pickavance stated that the
failure to proceed within the meaning of sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) must be interpreted
strictly (Tr. M., 30 May 2008, 160, 16-22) and confirmed the interpretation given in
paragraph 7.58 of his report, namely that: "the only way in which a Contractor could be
found to not have ‘proceeded with the works’ in accordance with 63.1(b)(ii) would be if
the Contractor substantially reduced its labour to a point where there is either no
progress, or the progress is de minimis" (Tr. M., 30 May 2008, 161-162, 18-25, 1-2).
The Tribunal is not persuaded by this interpretation, which would not make much sense
in practice, or in the words of Prof. Uff:

"| have construed the words of the Contract in order to make what is sometimes
called ‘Business common sense’, which always appeals to English judges and
Arbitrators. It seems to me to construe the clause as Mr. Pickavance and the
Claimant suggests doesn't make any sense because it would suggest that the
sequence of events is that the Contractor is going too slowly, a Clause 46 Notice is
served with the intention of speeding him up, but you can only act on that Notice by
terminating if he actually stops altogether. That doesn't seem to be a likely
sequence of events. It seems obvious to me that the clause is intended to refer to
a failure to comply with the Clause 46 Notice, and | believe you can arrive at that
conclusion within the words of the clause, but in any event, | suggest that the
clause at the very lowest should be construed as failing to proceed with the works
in accordance with the general requirements of the Contract, particularly Clause
41.1, that expressly requires the Contractor to proceed with due expedition and
without delay, irrespective of whether a Clause 46 Notice has been served."

(Tr. M., 30 May 2008, 167-168)

On the basis of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal has no hesitation in ruling
out a finding of conspiracy. Such a finding can in no circumstances derive solely from
a divergence of views on the interpretation of certain provisions of the Contract. As to

73

257.

259.

the other factual allegations made by the Claimant in this connection, as has been
shown, they are not sufficient either.

The additional argument advanced by Bayindir that PMC was economically dependent
upon Pakistan does not change this conclusion. The fact that ECIL, the lead partner of
PMC, may have worked extensively with the Pakistani government does not
necessarily entail that the PMC group overall or Mr. Mirza himself were economically
dependent upon Pakistan. And even if such dependence were proved, it would be
insufficient to establish that the Engineer acted in bad faith. As for the alleged
subservience shown in the correspondence, particularly in Mr. Mirza's letters to NHA
dated 19 September 2002 (Exh. [Pak.] CM-162) and 11 April 2001 (Exh. [Bay.] CX-
138), the Tribunal finds nothing in these letters suggesting bad faith on the part of
Mr. Mirza. To the contrary, in his letters, Mr. Mirza specified whether he was acting in
his capacity as Engineer or as consultant to NHA, thereby making it clear that he was
well aware of the different roles he was playing in the context of the Contract. That the
combination of these sometimes conflicting roles in one and the same person can be
problematic is well-known to anyone familiar with construction contracts. But that is a
different question. What matters here is that there is no concrete evidence of bias
which could potentially lead to a finding of treaty breach.

The Tribunal thus concludes that the existence of a conspiracy to expel Bayindir for
reasons unrelated to the latter's contract performance is not established. This
conclusion does not preclude the possibility of an expulsion for other reasons which in
and of themselves might be grounds for a treaty breach.

Reasons underlying the expulsion of Bayindir
2.1 Bayindir's position

Bayindir submits in essence that its expulsion was motivated by grounds unrelated to
its performance of the Contract and, more specifically, by the following three "sovereign
reasons": "to serve Pakistan's changing political imperatives, to save money in a time
of acute financial difficulty, and to favour local contractors" (PHB [Bay.] 4 34).

74

261.

First, regarding the changing political priorities, Bayindir argues that the Project was
constantly subject to shifts in the political winds, political pressures, and the "tit-for-tat"
referred to by Mr. Afzal that came with the changes in the Pakistani government (PHB
Bay.] 435). More specifically, Bayindir contends that the impact of a change of
government must be assessed in light of the precedents before the revival of the
Contract in 1997 (Reply M. 124), in particular the divergent positions of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was favourable to the Project, and Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, who opposed it as a tactic to "befool the public" and "gain cheap publicity" (Exh.
Bay.] CX-16; PHB [Bay.] { 37) and terminated the Contract. Moreover, Bayindir also
alleges that the government of General Musharraf, which came to power in October
1999, took an aggressive stance against the Project "in the light of Pakistan's financial
problems necessitating a change in policy" (Reply M. 129 and 132). Bayindir
refers, in particular, to the answer of NHA to a question by the National Assembly of
Pakistan, in which it admitted that projects, including M-1, were delayed due to
changes in priorities of the subsequent governments and financial constraints (Reply
M., 4210: Exh. [Bay.] CX-230).

Second, in connection with Pakistan's financial difficulties, Bayindir alleges, that as a
result of the nuclear tests in May 1998 and of General Musharraf's coup in October
1999, financial institutions were unwilling to extend credit to Pakistan (Reply M., 4 129:
Exh. [Bay.] CX-168; PHB [Bay.] 42). Moreover, when General Musharraf came to
power, he imposed a policy of fiscal discipline (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 9, 10-5), which led

 

to a reassessment of the Project to take into account the funding problems. To support
this allegation, Bayindir relies primarily on a document entitled "Talking Points for the
Prime Minister" intended for the meeting with Bayindir's Chairman on 12 October 1999
(Exh. [Bay.] CX-170-B) and to the recommendations of a committee, established by the
Musharraf government in November 1999, that the M-1 Project be reduced from six to
four lanes (Exh. [Bay.] CX-169). This recommendation was later approved by General
Musharraf (Exh. [Bay.] CX-170-A; Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 30, 8-11). In Bayindir's
submission, these documents show that with the advent of General Musharraf's
government the Project came under increased scrutiny not because of a deficient
performance on the part of Bayindir, but because of the financial constraints
experienced by Pakistan.

75

262.

264.

Bayindir further argues that the Respondent's financial situation deteriorated in the year
2000. Referring to the oral testimonies of Mr. Wall, then World Bank country Director
for Pakistan, and of Mr. Afzal, then Pakistan's Secretary of Finance, Bayindir points out
that in the summer of 2000 Pakistan was facing a balance of payment crisis and
actively seeking to conclude a standby agreement with the IMF (PHB [Bay.] 4 42). At
the same time, Bayindir refers to the “liquidity crunch" that NHA experienced by the fall
of 2000 and the lack of funds to cover the promissory notes that were coming due on
the M-1 Project, a situation which prompted the Ministry of Communications to seek
further funds from the Ministry of Finance (PHB [Bay.] { 41).

Bayindir links the financial difficulties to its expulsion by referring to the following
sequence of events. The standby agreement which was eventually reached in
November 2000 specified revenue and expenditure targets. Being unable to meet
those targets, Pakistan announced in April 2001 a revised budget in which funds
available for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) were substantially
reduced. This reduction had an adverse impact on NHA's budgetary situation, which
Bayindir describes as follows:

"NHA received funding, including the funding for the M-1 Project, through the

PSDP, and, as Mr. Afzal stated in no uncertain terms, NHA was expected to live

within its PSDP allocation. As of April 11, 2001, the Secretary General of Finance

was advised that NHA had Rs. 2.86 billion PSDP funds remaining for all NHA

projects. Under the revised PSDP budget, however, NHA was facing a budget

reduction of Rs. 3.1 billion, which would effectively place NHA in a deficit situation.

However, in addition to NHA's projected remaining funds of Rs. 2.86 billion, NHA

anticipated a release of Rs. 1.5 billion which had already been allocated specifically

"to meet the liability of M/s Bayindir" [ .... ] Unless NHA could avoid using the Rs.

1.5 billion release to satisfy Pakistan's obligations to Bayindir, the projected Rs. 3.1

billion PSDP budget cut would exceed NHA's remaining Rs. 2.86 billion PSDP

allowance. Bayindir was owed Rs. 1.5 billion and more on account of IPC 20, IPC

21, and IPA 22. But the solution was simple enough [ ... ] [Pakistan] stopped work

on the M-1 Project, a low priority project under the Musharraf Government, and it

stopped payments to Bayindir, freeing up the Rs. 1.5 billion for NHA's other PSDP

project."

(PHB [Bay.] 11 43-44)
In Bayindir's contention the M-1 Project was chosen as a target because it had come
under severe criticism from the World Bank and the Expert Group convened by the
Respondent and financed by a grant from the Japanese government administered by
the World Bank (PHB [Bay. 45-46) to the effect that the M-1 Project was financially
unviable and that termination would result in a saving of costs (Reply M. 207-209;
Exh. [Bay.] CX-139). It thereby strengthened the internal opposition within the

76

267.

268.

Pakistani government against the continuation of the Project. Further, according to a
note prepared by NHA for the Finance Minister on 6 January 2000, the M-1 Project was
specified to be a low priority project (Reply M., 151; Exh. [Bay.] CX-196).

It was allegedly in this context that the then Minister of Communications, General Qazi,
requested a meeting with General Musharraf "to get his decision on [the] future of the
M-1 project" (PHB [Bay.] ¢ 47), which was held on 12 April 2001. Bayindir emphasizes
in this respect that

"It is evident from the face of this memorandum requesting the meeting that the
need for General Musharraf's intervention was not driven by contractual concerns
or Project delays - the focus, as ever, was on the financial difficulties that
Bayindir's M-1 Project posed for Pakistan and NHA."

(PHB [Bay.] 4.47)

Bayindir claims that the decision to end the Project and expel it was taken by General
Musharraf. It summarizes its general argument with respect to the financial reasons
underlying its expulsion as follows:

"with no funding available and an expensive, financially unviable project on its
hands, the Government decided to sacrifice Bayindir in the name of sovereign
financial discipline.”

(PHB [Bay.] ¢ 48)

Third, with respect to the alleged favouritism to the benefit of local contractors, Bayindir
contends that its expulsion not only solved Pakistan's funding difficulties but also
allowed the M-1 Project to proceed

"because Pakistan could save money and still complete the M-1 motorway by
engaging local contractors in Bayindir's stead. Even with the savings that Pakistan
would reap, the local contractors stood to benefit from taking over the M-1 Project
from Bayindir and were eager to do so. And indeed, local contractors were waiting
in the wings, ready to take over the Project.”

(PHB [Bay.] ¢.49)

More specifically, Bayindir points out that the completion of the Project by influential
local contractors was recommended by NHA's advisors and was decided prior to the
expulsion as evidenced by a number of documents and statements of NHA officials
(Reply M., 91 214, 217, 219: Exh. [Bay.] CX-96, CX-139, CX-206, CX-224). According
to Bayindir, Mr. Kamal Nasir Khan, the Deputy Managing Director of Saadullah Khan &
Brothers (SKB), and a consortium of local contractors exerted pressure on Mr. Cértilk,
Bayindir's Chairman, to assign the Project to them (Reply M., 216; Exh. [Bay.] CX-
235). Eventually, the award of the Project to Pakistan Motorway Contractors Joint

77

269.

270.

271.

272.

Venture (PMC-JV), a local consortium led by SKB, was the result of a corrupt tender
process, evidencing NHA's real motives for expelling Bayindir, namely saving cost and
favouring influential local contractors (Reply M. 218-219). For Bayindir, NHA was in
fact directly involved in the creation of PMC-JV, as evidenced by contemporaneous
press reports (Exh. [Bay.] CX-106) as well as by a letter from the Vigilance Wing
describing PMC-JV as "the Consortium which was constituted by concerned NHA
officials through negotiations with concerned firms mainly SKB" (Exh. [Bay.] CX-236-A),
and as confirmed by the oral testimony of Mr. Nasir Khan (PHB [Bay.] 4.52).

In Bayindir's submission, it is for these three reasons that it was expelled and not
because of its performance under the Contract. At the hearing, Bayindir noted that the
documents reviewed in this regard make little or no mention of performance problems
(Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 6, 12-19).

 

Bayindir acknowledges that there were delays in the completion of the Project for
reasons that are disputed. It adds that even if those delays were attributable to
Bayindir, Pakistan's response was "grossly disproportionate to whatever problems
existed on the Project" (PHB [Bay.] 4 60) and was "all the more egregious when viewed
in light of Pakistan’s and NHA's own culpability for the delays on the Project" (PHB
Bay.] {_ 66) stemming mainly from Pakistan's failure to acquire and properly transfer
land to Bayindir and from the assignment of additional work to Bayindir which was not
contemplated when the Priority Sections deadlines were set in Addendum No. 9 (PHB
Bay.] 4/75).

In any case, Bayindir stresses that any delays or other problems relating to contractual
performance were not the reason that moved the Pakistani government to take the
decision to expel Bayindir. Such decision was instead the expression of governmental
interference with the Contract.

2.2 Pakistan's position

As a general matter, it is Pakistan's case that it was truly committed to the Project and
that the change of the Project's scope and completion dates was not due to its financial
constraints but to Bayindir's failure to arrange a foreign currency loan and to the latter's
poor contractual performance (Rej. M., 3.53).

78

273.

274.

275.

The Respondent replies to Bayindir's allegations relating to the shifts in political winds
that events pre-dating the entry into force of the Treaty on 3 September 1997 are not
covered by the protections afforded by the Treaty and lie outside the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal (C-Mem. M., {| 4.8). Moreover, the Pakistani government which came to
power in October 1999 wished to continue the Project and retain Bayindir as the
Contractor (Rej. M., 4 3.3). More specifically, Pakistan argues that:

"The evidence shows that the decision to expel was made by NHA, acting on its
own following the issuance of a Clause 63.1 Certification by the Engineer,
subsequent to 12 April 2001, albeit with the high level approval that — so far as
concerns the general diplomatic fallout — it could act in accordance with the terms
of the Contract. This has two important consequences. First, and most
obviously, Bayindir's case of conspiracy fails. Secondly, the case comes down to
the exercise by NHA of a contractual right, divorced from interference by the
State. The fact that President Musharraf might have, but did not, discourage
NHA from exercising its contractual rights because of broader diplomatic reasons
in no way constitutes relevant interference."

(PHB [Pak.] 9] 2.76-2.78)

In addition, Pakistan notes that General Musharraf was diplomatically and personally
fond of Turkey and appreciated the fact that the Project was in the hands of a Turkish

contractor.

In connection with Bayindir's allegations about Pakistan's financial constraints and
balance of payment crisis, Pakistan notes that the "Talking Points for the Prime
Minister" referred to by Bayindir do not support the Claimant's allegations. Quite to the
contrary, this document shows that Bayindir had difficulties sourcing credit in the
international market (Rej. M., 3.26). According to Pakistan, the contemporaneous
record shows that it was Bayindir's inability to arrange the foreign exchange component
of the loan that caused the financing and the scope of the Project to be revisited. As a
result of Bayindir's failure to arrange the foreign currency loan, Pakistan had indeed to
finance the Project itself. The position of NHA's legal advisor at the time, Mr. Farrukh
Qureshi (now Bayindir's counsel), was that "[Bayindir's] letter dated 23.10.99
tantamounts to a repudiation of contract entitling NHA to accept such repudiation and
terminate the contract should it consider to do so" (Exh. [Pak.] CM-52). Instead, NHA
and Pakistan opted against termination and for negotiation (Rej. M., (3.28).

Pakistan further alleges that the very fact that Addendum No. 9 was concluded in early
2000, at a time when Pakistan was facing serious financial concerns, disproves

79

276.

277.

Bayindir's assertion that its expulsion in 2001 was motivated by financial
considerations, as Pakistan's financial position at that time was more secure. NHA did
not give in to the opposition from Pakistan's Planning Division or to the advice from the
World Bank. It rather maintained its view that the Project should be completed by the
Contractor, as evidenced by the conclusion of Addendum No. 9, which was highly
favourable to Bayindir (Rej. M., {13.55 - 3.65). Nothing in the minutes of the 7
November 2000 meeting chaired by the Minister of Communications in any way
supports the proposition that a decision was taken to discontinue the Project owing to
financial constraints. In fact, it was decided that the Project might continue (PHB [Pak.
(3.2). If Pakistan nevertheless remained cautious, this was because of Bayindir's past
poor performance. Similarly, General Javed testified that he made no mention of
financial constraints in his presentation to the Chief Executive on 23 February 2001,
and that his reference in this presentation to Bayindir's high rates was only to illustrate
the incentive that Bayindir should have had to make progress swiftly (PHB [Pak.] 3.2).

In addition, Pakistan stresses that, contrary to Bayindir's contention, the budget
available to NHA for the Project was not restricted to the PSDP allocation. NHA could
rely upon another budgetary stream, the current budget, which was many times larger
than the PSDP and could have been employed for the Project. NHA was provided with
funds from the PSDP for the express purpose of meeting its liabilities to Bayindir for the
period from April to June 2001. The provision would have covered payments not only
in respect of IPCs 20 and 21, but also IPA 22. NHA did not pay IPCs 20 and 21
because, under the Contract, these IPCs were not to be paid until the final accounting
at the end of the Project's Defects Liability Period (PHB [Pak.] { 3.2). It took this
decision on the basis of legal advice, which was subsequently confirmed by a decision
of the Engineer, and, in this arbitration, further supported by the expert testimony of
Mr. Chapman.

Pakistan argues that, in any case, Bayindir's allegation that the M-1 Project was not a
priority is unsupported by the evidence on record. The note on which Bayindir relies in
this regard states that priority should be given to ongoing projects which included M-1.
It then concludes that the balance of the Turk-Exim Bank loan was sufficient for the
current financial year and that "efforts would be made to remain within the budgetary
allocations, as far as the Rupee portion was concerned" (Rej. M.. {1 3.40-3.41).

80

278.

279.

Further, Pakistan submits that it did not anticipate any savings from the expulsion of
Bayindir. Quite on the contrary, it advised NHA that the latter would probably not gain
financially from an expulsion and that there was likely to be a substantial windfall to
Bayindir at the end of the Defects Liability Period (Rej. M., (13.126 - 3.127 and 3.136 -
3.140).

Pakistan also rebuts Bayindir's third allegation pursuant to which the expulsion was
effected to favour local contractors. It replies that neither the government nor NHA had
any contacts with SKB before the expulsion (Rej. M. 3.153, 3.171 - 3.173), that it is
not established that the decision to complete the works with local contractors preceded
the one to expel Bayindir (Rej. M., {1 3.152, 3.164 - 3.170), that any suggestion of
collusion is disproved by the fact that NHA’s attempts to continue parts of the works
with local contractors were stopped by the very contractors with whom it is supposed to
have colluded (Rej. M.. § 3.154). Finally, Pakistan notes that the completion of the
works with Bayindir’s subcontractors was in any event a natural course of action
expressly permitted under sub-clause 63.1 of the Contract.

More generally, for Pakistan it was Bayindir’s poor performance under the Contract that
led to the expulsion (PHB [Pak. 6.56 — 6.62). Bayindir's progress was slow from the
start and the financial resources it invested in the Project were inadequate (Exh. [Pak.
CM-47). General Javed referred in his statement to the minutes of the Contract
Progress Meeting No. 18 for December 1999, showing that Bayindir was experiencing
a lack of cash flow, which was adversely affecting its progress. Contrary to Bayindir's
contention, the delays cannot be explained by the unavailability of the land. Indeed,
most of the land had been properly handed over, except for an encumbered stretch of
4 kms that was de minimis given the overall lack of progress of Bayindir (Rej. M., 1
3.16-3.17). Moreover, the Chairman of Bayindir, Mr. Kamuran Cértik, testified in
response to a question from the Turkish Parliamentary Committee investigating the
purchase of the television station Genc TV in November 1998, that 30 to 40 million
dollars originating from Pakistan had been used for this acquisition (Rej. M., 4.3.9). In
Pakistan's submission, Bayindir was itself undergoing a "credit crunch" that caused it to
be constantly under-resourced, to fail to acquire adequate equipment, and to display a
chronic inability to pay its subcontractors in spite of NHA's regular and prompt payment
of IPCs.

2.3 Tribunal's determination

To assess the merits of these allegations, the Tribunal will focus on two issues: first,
whether the Claimant was expelled for reasons unrelated to its performance (2.3.1);
second, whether the Claimant's contractual performance had an impact on the
Respondent's acts allegedly in breach of the Treaty (2.3.2).

2.3.1. Expulsion unrelated to Contract performance?

To answer the first issue about the reasons unrelated to performance, the Tribunal will
consider whether the evidence supports the existence of political shifts (2.3.1.1), of
financial difficulties (2.3.1.2), and of attempts to favour local contractors (2.3.1.3).

2.3.1.1. Political shifts

In its post-hearing brief, the Claimant relied on the oral testimony of Mr. Afzal to claim
that it had been the victim of "political pressures" and "tit-for-tat" political dynamics
between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and, his successor, Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto. Whereas Mr. Sharif had fully supported the Project, Ms. Bhutto had not,
irrespective of Bayindir's performance. However, these events occurred prior to the
entry into force of the Treaty on 3 September 1997 and the disputes arising from them
have been settled (see section IV(A)(c) supra). These events are thus not susceptible
of founding a treaty breach in these proceedings. They can merely be taken into
account for a better understanding of the relevant facts.

With respect to the period following the entry into force of the Treaty, Bayindir argues
that a further political shift occurred in October 1999 with the advent of the government
of General Musharraf. The new government is said to have taken an aggressive
stance against the Project. The Tribunal is, however, unpersuaded by the evidence put
forward by the Claimant. The answer provided by NHA to a question of the National
Assembly of Pakistan (Exh. [Bay.] CX-230), upon which the Claimant relies, does not
show an "aggressive stance." While it indeed refers to delays due to changes in policy,
it also mentions that "with prudent handling" most of the "sick projects” including M-1
“are now on track" (Exh. [Bay.] CX-230).

82

287.

288.

Asked in cross-examination when Bayindir started to perceive the alleged hostility of
the new government, Mr. Jilani, Bayindir's area manager, gave inconclusive answers.
He was unable to put a date on some of the assertions he made in his written
statement. To a question seeking to elicit what time period he intended to cover when
writing that "the correspondence that Bayindir started to receive from the NHA and the
Engineer clearly revealed to me that efforts were being made to find an excuse to take
the Project away from Bayindir," he replied "a very wide period" from the 1999 takeover
of Pakistan by General Musharraf to December 2000 when the sub-clause 46.1 notice
was received (Tr. M., 27 May 2008, 31, 19-25).

This answer omits the crucial fact that during that time span Bayindir was confirmed in
its position of Contractor by the conclusion of Addendum No. 9. The Addendum No. 9
provided inter alia for a revised completion date, the reduction of the Project from six to
four lanes, a rescheduling of the recovery of the Mobilisation Advance, the settlement
of foreign currency payments in Pakistani rupees at the conversion rate of the date of
payment, the deletion of certain works, the immediate resumption of work by Bayindir,
and the handover of remaining land by NHA within a set deadline (Exh. [Bay.] C-18).
The conclusion of Addendum No. 9 can hardly be seen as an "attempt to take the
Project away from Bayindir" nor as an indication of an adverse political shift constituting
a breach of fair and equitable treatment.

In this context, the Tribunal also notes General Qazi's testimony according to which
Pakistan's diplomatic relations and General Musharraf's personal contacts with Turkey
had a positive rather than an adverse effect on Bayindir's position (Tr. M., 28 May
2008, 313-314).

 

2.3.1.2. Financial difficulties

The evidence, including the testimony of Mr. Afzal, at the time Pakistan's Secretary of
Finance, and of Mr. Wall, at the time World Bank Country Director for Pakistan, shows
that Pakistan was indeed undergoing financial difficulties when General Musharraf
came to power. Mr. Afzal confirmed that "the ratings suffered a shattering blow after
the nuclear tests of May 1998" and "continued to be precarious" (Tr. M., 28 May 2008.
111, 11-13 and 17), and that General Musharraf's accession to power adversely

 

affected Pakistan's access to international institutional lending (Tr. M., 28 May 2008.

83

289.

290.

291.

56, 17-24). This evidence was corroborated by Mr. Wall, who mentioned that Pakistan
faced a balance of payment crisis in the year 2000 (Tr. M., 30 May 2008, 131, 4-5).

In essence, Bayindir argues that these difficulties led to a reduction of the scope of the
Project, while Pakistan replies that it was Bayindir's inability to arrange the foreign
exchange component of the loan which led to a review of the Project's scope and
finance mechanism. It is undisputed that Bayindir was not able to raise a foreign
currency loan. It is disputed, however, whether Bayindir was under an obligation to do
so or under a mere duty to exert best efforts. In reality, this dispute ultimately does not
matter. On the facts, it cannot be denied that financial considerations played an
important role in the review of the Project. But the difficulties were resolved and the
Project continued.

The content of Addendum No. 9 concluded in 2000 leaves no doubt in this respect. Its
preamble emphasizes the reason for the review:

"WHEREAS Bayindir has informed NHA through its letter reference No.
IPM/OK/NHA/292 dated October 23, 1999 that Bayindir is unable to arrange
further Foreign Currency Credit for the construction of Islamabad — Peshawar
Motorway Project in terms of the Agreement for The Revival of Contract
Agreement for the Construction of The Islamabad — Peshawar Motorway dated 3
July 1997.

AND WHEREAS NHA has agreed to arrange the remaining funding for the
Project and has resultantly reduced the work and extended the Completion Date
in view of the non-availability of the said Foreign Currency Credit."

(Exh. [Bay.] C-18).

The Tribunal concludes that the solution reached in the form of Addendum No. 9
evidences the Respondent's willingness to continue with the Project, and not the
reverse.

Bayindir’s further argument about the influence of the World Bank's negative
assessment of the viability of the Project does not appear better founded. The World
Bank’s opinion does not seem to have had much impact on Pakistan’s decision-making
processes. As noted at hearing by Mr. Afzal on cross-examination, it was seen as a
mere suggestion, and often disregarded:

"You see, look, the point | am making a little different. | am making two points.
One is that the World Bank's view on the viability of the Project, even continuation
at that stage, was something that they had been consistent with, ever since the
inception of the Project, so incidentally was the Planning Commission. Maybe
they changed it at the very end. All | am saying is that these were in the form of

84

292.

294.

suggestions, and in my original letter, if | recall, | cited two or three cases, but let
me just specify those. There was the Chashma nuclear power programme which
we had assisted with the assistance of the Chinese Government in 1991, 1992,
and was, you know, consistently opposed by the World Bank, right through, and
this was, by the way, in the time of the policy loans. We went ahead with it, and
incidentally today everybody thinks, well, we did a good job [...]. Then there was
this Lady Health Workers programme, which was started in Ms. Bhutto's
Government time [...] Now, when it was started, the World Bank thought,
because, unfortunately, Ms. Bhutto's Government had acquired a bad reputation
for, you know, giving employment where it was undeserved, even in schools, they
thought this was another programme which was just there to recruit people and
give jobs. In fact, it is today continuing with about 100,000 workers. We have
had several assessments, including that by third parties like the Oxford Policy
Management Group, and they think it is one of the most successful public health
programmes in the region. So, you know, this sort of advice would come and go,
and we would have a healthy exchange."

(Tr. M., 28" May 2008, 64-65, 2-25. 1-18) [testimony of Mr Wall].

Bayindir also seeks to establish that the Respondent's financial situation further
deteriorated throughout the year 2000 and that by the fall of 2000 NHA was facing a
"liquidity crunch." It argues that the reduction of NHA's PSDP allocation prompted NHA
to seek an exit strategy from the M-1 Project, which was draining a large portion of its
resources and had come under severe criticism from the World Bank and parts of the
Pakistani government. The Claimant thus seeks to establish a causal link between
Pakistan's financial difficulties and the decision to expel it.

As the record stands, such a link is not established. Pakistan contends that NHA had
at its disposal another budget stream larger than the PSDP. At the hearing, Mr. Afzal
confirmed that "the national highways authorities, as | said, would get its budget
allocation through two different streams. One is the PSDP, and one is the current
budget" (Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 41, 13-16). He restated so in cross-examination:

"Q: Right. What | am trying to understand is whether you are suggesting that

the M-1 Project was funded within or outside the PSDP or both?

A: Both."

(Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 44, 5-8).
This testimony is corroborated, as the Respondent pointed out, by a letter from NHA to
Bayindir of 17 July 2000 (Exh. [Bay.] CX-251), which suggests the existence of funds in

addition to those stemming from the PSDP allocation for the financial year 2000-2001.

To counter this evidence, Bayindir refers to a note for the Finance Minister dated 6
January 2000, which in part reads as follows:

85

297.

"[o]n the subject of prioritization of NHA's Development Program the Finance
Minister observed that first priority should be assigned to the completion of
ongoing projects and within ongoing projects higher priority should be assigned
to N-5 projects and then to rehabilitation/reconstruction of National Highway
Network other than N-5."

(Exh. [Bay.] CX-196).

There is nothing in this note suggesting that the M-1 Project was not a priority. Quite to
the contrary, the priority goes to "completion of ongoing projects," which would appear
to cover the M-1 Project. The M-1 Project is then discussed in more detail, but the note
concludes merely that a decision from the Finance Minister is requested so that the
proposals made by Bayindir (including the payment of the foreign exchange portion in
cash in equivalent Pakistan rupees) can be turned into an agreement. In this context,
one should note that the fact that the Project may have been viewed as a priority is in
line with the country’s diplomatic and General Musharraf's personal ties with Turkey
(Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 313-314).

For these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the financial situation
referred to by the Claimant cannot be considered a decisive cause of Bayindir's
expulsion.

2.3.1.3. Local contractors

The same reasoning applies to Bayindir's allegation that the purpose of its expulsion
was to save resources and complete the Project at lesser cost with local contractors.
While it is plausible that NHA and the government considered ways of cutting costs, it
is not established that this consideration triggered the expulsion of Bayindir and the
decision to continue the Project with local contractors.

Bayindir refers to a number of documents allegedly demonstrating the intent to favour
local contractors. These documents include a letter from the Vigilance Wing, press
reports, and a memorandum of understanding signed by NHA with the local contractors
before the launch of the tender procedure. Bayindir also relies on the testimony of
Mr. Nasir Khan, all to sustain that, prior to the expulsion of Bayindir, NHA had
undertaken the constitution of a consortium of local contractors to take over the Project.
Bayindir claims that such conduct evidences the real motives underlying its expulsion.

86

300.

301.

302.

On the basis of the documents to which the Claimant mainly refers (Exh. [Bay.] CX-96.
CX-106, CX-139, CX-206, CX-224, CX-235, CX-236-A), the Tribunal agrees that NHA
and the government had in mind the possibility of completing the Project with local

 

contractors. However, this conclusion does not necessarily entail that they preferred to
do so, or, even if they did, that the decision to expel Bayindir resulted from such
preference. Absent any indication on record to these effects, the Tribunal cannot deem
these facts established.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has taken into account that the record does
not support Bayindir's allegation of corruption in the tendering process. Moreover, it
appears to the Tribunal that any employer facing the unpleasant prospect of having to
terminate a construction contract before completion would by necessity seek to identify
alternative solutions. Envisaging the use of Bayindir's subcontractors to continue the
works was certainly a sensible alternative. Indeed, it goes without saying that it makes
more sense to try to retain the subcontractors who have already worked on the project
rather than to resort to newcomers. These circumstances cannot be viewed as an
indication that Pakistan's motivation for the termination was to favour local contractors
and save costs.

2.3.2. Bayindir's performance

The foregoing conclusions are supported by a review of Bayindir's perfomance. In
essence, the Claimant submits that the internal documentation of NHA and the
government contained no or little mention of deficient performance on its part, while
Pakistan’s financial problems received far more attention. It adds that, even if its
performance had not been satisfactory, expulsion was a disproportionate remedy,
which is additional proof that the motivation lay elsewhere. In response, the
Respondent refers extensively to contemporaneous documentation, mainly monthly
progress reports and correspondence, to establish Bayindir's poor contractual
performance (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 189-236, 240-273; see also PHB [Pak.] {3.78 —
3.96, 3.99 — 3.106, 6.56 — 6.62).

 

 

As a threshold matter, the Tribunal notes that there can be no objection against relying
on monthly progress reports and correspondence issued by the Engineer or its
Representative, as the latter were not shown to be biased or acting in collusion with

87

303.

304.

305.

NHA and the government. It also notes that Mr. Sadik Can, President of Bayindir
Construction Company, testified that, together with reports on expenses, monthly
progress reports were the main written sources regarding Bayindir's project
management (Tr. M., 27 May 2009, 254-255, 22-25, 1-2).

The Tribunal stresses that in assessing this evidence it has taken into account the
arguments advanced by the Parties in connection with the evidentiary weight of
Mr. Mirza's testimony as well as the fact that Mr. Mirza was not available to appear at
the hearing for cross-examination. Due to the confidential nature of the reasons
alleged for Mr. Mirza's non-appearance, the positions of the Parties cannot be restated
in this Award. However, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed all circumstances and
concluded that, because the Claimant had no opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Mirza,
the latter's written evidence could only be considered if corroborated by other evidence
in the record.

The record substantiates the Respondent's negative assessment of Bayindir's
contractual performance. Already immediately after the conclusion of Addendum
No. 9, there is evidence that Bayindir's performance, particularly the level of re-
mobilization and funds committed, was insufficient in the opinion of the Engineer's
Representative (Exh. [Pak.] CM-65, CM-66). There is further evidence of this fact in
the monthly progress reports for September and October 2000 (Exh. [Pak.] CM-8, CM-
9) and in a letter from the Engineer to Bayindir of 7 October 2000 (Exh. [Pak.] CM-73).

It is true that the press release of the site visit of General Qazi on 12 September 2000,
to which Bayindir refers (Exh. [Bay.] CX-31), states that the Minister of
Communications had "expressed satisfaction over the pace of work." Yet, that press
release is insufficient to establish the satisfactory performance of Bayindir or rebut
strong evidence to the contrary. Government releases are often couched in prudent or
diplomatic terms. More specifically, this release contains another passage to which
General Qazi referred in his examination (Ir. M., 28 May 2008, 292, 16-20) and which
states that "[the Minister] directed the experts to further gear up the pace of work on the
project so that it could be completed at the earliest" (Exh. [Bay.] CX-31). In his oral
testimony, General Qazi confirmed that, after his visit to the site, he was not satisfied
with Bayindir's pace of work:

88

“Based on what | had seen before the briefing, because first, we made the visit.
We made the round. Then we came to the place which was -— they called it,
‘Camp office’, and over there the briefing was given on the charts, and all. | had
already visited the site. You had seen the work that was going on, and frankly, |
was a bit disappointed to see that the number of machines deployed were too
less, and the outfieldwork and the carting of the earth was mostly being done by
donkeys, so | said, 'How can you meet the targets by such a slow-moving
actions that are going on?' And | was told that, ‘Well, these are the local
subcontractors, and we are — 'we have deployed machines and we will deploy
more machines’, and they are working on other parts of the roads, that is why
you could not see them. So | said, ‘But all the same, | am not satisfied, the way
the work is going on, because when | drove beyond the road after which | was
ruled (sic) [told] to go, then | could see that large portions there was nobody
working, and then they said, 'Well, we have divided up the road and people
would be working on those portions also’, so overall, my impression, as |
carried, was not very happy one. | was a bit unhappy with the pace of work that
| saw, and the amount of machines deployed that | saw, and then when the
briefing was given, | was told by Bayindir that they would be able to meet the
target, which was two asks (sic) [weeks] by March 2001, and the complete road
by December. So, | had very serious doubts, and then the Engineer gave his
assessment, and he pointed out that with the amount of work, the percentage of
work they had done so far, there was no way they would be able to meet the
target unless they undertook some extraordinary measures and deployed more
resources and machines. So, |, at that time, told the Bayindir representative, a
gentleman called Jilani, Mr. Jilani, | told him, | said, 'Listen, you better deploy
more machines and bring in more resources so that you can meet the targets,
because we want to make this motorway, and we want you to finish the work on
time’, which he promised that he would do."

(Tr. M., 28 May 2008, 289-291).

Similar concerns were expressed later by General Javed, the Chairman of NHA, on the
occasion of a visit to the site on 25 November 2000. These concerns are recorded in
his notes, which the Engineer forwarded to Bayindir on 5 December 2000 (Exh. [Pak.
RB-43). General Javed confirmed his doubts in oral testimony:

"The first remark that | made to the Bayindir people was that | have yet to have
a critical analysis of your output, and | haven't seen any of the Engineer's
reports, but they said that the critical activity appears to be the earthwork. The
earthwork was the most critical activity, and | distinctly remember having told
them that, 'Critical activity for you is the earthwork, unless you put your act
together you will have no hope in hell to complete this section come 23" of
March’. So, certainly, this is absolutely right. They were far behind the
schedule, at that point in time, with respect to the other areas, also, but
earthwork, amongst the order of the works is probably the first one [...]."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 112, 5-21).

None of Bayindir's witnesses were examined on these facts, whereas Mr. Bridger's
testimony confirmed that Bayindir's performance remained unsatisfactory in the months
preceding the issuance of the sub-clause 46.1 notice at the beginning of December
2000 (Bridger's WS, {62 — 73; Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 189, 2-12). Referring to his

89

308.

309.

86

remarks in the November 2000 monthly progress reports, Mr. Bridger testified that
earthwork quantities on Parts 1 and 5 combined were 45% less than the November
target and that Part 1 had fallen significantly behind schedule (Bridger's WS, (71). By
the end of November, Messrs. Bridger and Mirza considered that Bayindir's
performance was such that they needed to issue the sub-clause 46.1 notice "before it
became too late for BCI to have the opportunity to bring the Project back on program"
(Bridger's WS, 72).

After the issuance of the sub-clause 46.1 notice on 2 December 2000, Bayindir's
progress remained unsatisfactory, as is evidenced by a letter from Mr. Bridger to
Bayindir of 11 December 2000 (Exh. [Pak.] CM-79), and by the December 2000
monthly progress report (Exh. [Pak.] CM-11). Mr. Finn followed up with several
reminders in January 2001 (Exh. [Pak.] CM-83, CM-84, CM-86). The monthly progress
reports for January, February and March 2001 also show that Bayindir's progress was
insufficient (Exh. [Pak.] CM-12, CM-13, CM-14). Mr. Bridger explained at the hearing
that productivity decreased although Bayindir had added equipment (Tr. M., 29 May
2008, 193, 2-8).

Bayindir submits that, in assessing its performance over these months, the Engineer
and his Representative improperly disregarded the fact that progress was being
hindered by reasons attributable to the Respondent. This issue has been partly
addressed in paragraphs 245-250 supra. Asked at the hearing about his assessment
of the obstacles allegedly excusing the delays, Mr. Bridger gave the following answer:

"Q: So they invited you to a joint inspection, you and a representative of the
Employer. Bayindir witnesses have testified that you never accepted the
invitation.

A: That is absolutely right. | didn't.

Q: You did not?

A: | did not, but | inspected this site twice myself, once before the meeting of
19" of March, and once just before | sent out my letter [...] | went through the
site with my Resident Engineers, | declined to go through with Bayindir because
| didn't want the coercion — | didn't want to be pressured by Bayindir. | believe |
knew exactly what Mr. Jilani said on the meeting of the 19" of March, and it was
absolutely incorrect. The assertions he was making about what | had seen on
site, and | did not want to go on site with them and be pressured in any way. [...]
Q [THE PRESIDENT]: Well, can | just ask; what did you mean by being
pressured by Bayindir? Would they otherwise pressure you?

See also Mr. Bridger's statement referred to earlier that: "by and large the Contractor was way
behind without any cause of delay from external influences" (Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 189, 10-12).

90

310.

311.

A: | think they held a view that was contrary to what the actual circumstances
were. They were obviously not going to back down from it, and to travel with
them over 150 kilometres one way, and then back the other way 100 kilometres
to my office, that is 250 kilometres, sitting with Bayindir telling me that black is
white, | didn't enjoy the thought of that, so | didn't travel with them. [...]

Q [THE PRESIDENT]: So the relationship was a difficult one?

A: At that stage, after the 19" of March meeting it was. Up until then | had had
very good relations with Bayindir. | was probably generous in the way |
administered the Contract towards Bayindir because | believe that if the
Contractor is treated fairly, and he gets his due payments, it is going to expedite
the Contract. | had very good relations with all the — all three Project Managers,
but after this 19" of March meeting, things became quite acrimonious with
Bayindir, and | was going to be absolutely independent of them in every way
possible.

Q [THE PRESIDENT]: So the turning point was the 19" of March meeting?

A: Oh, | believe that was a turning point, major turning point, yes."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 215-218)

At that 19 March 2001 meeting, the Employer and the Engineer's Representative had
indeed expressed their concerns about Bayindir's unsatisfactory progress (Tr. M, 29

 

May 2008, 216, 3-8). The minutes of the meeting show that presentations were made
by Mr. Bridger (pointing to Bayindir's deficient performance despite several reminders)
and by Mr. Jilani (regarding the progress on the site). The minutes record that the
Chairman of NHA intervened several times during Mr. Jilani's presentation to express
concern about Bayindir's progress (Exh. [Pak.] CM-97).

Bayindir has sought to show that the minutes do not reflect the discussions held at the
meeting, but to no avail. Mr. Jilani's testimony on this point at the hearing was
unconvincing. Although he confirmed that the 19 March 2001 meeting was regarded
as an important meeting, he stated that neither he nor Mr. Can, who attended for
Bayindir, took any notes "because [the] Engineer was prepared, taking, | guess, the
notes. We were not taking notes" (Tr. M., 27 May 2008. 67, 16-18). Moreover, he was
unable to point to any evidence that he had asked Mr. Bridger for the draft minutes (Ir.
M., 27 May 2008, 68, 12-16). Mr. Can's testimony was hardly more convincing. Asked
whether he was aware of a letter sent by Mr. Bridger to Bayindir's project manager one
week after the 19 March meeting, stating that the list of obstructions presented by Mr.
Jilani at the meeting was obsolete (Exh. [Pak.] RB-67), Mr. Can was unable to answer
whether Bayindir had replied or not, later noting that he was not involved in daily
correspondence (Tr. M., 27 May 2008, 260-262).

91

312.

313.

314.

Pakistan also relies on a letter that Mr. Bridger sent to Bayindir on 16 February 2001,
noting that the value of the equipment permanently imported by Bayindir was well
below Bayindir's commitment (Exh. [Pak.] CM-91). Mr. Bridger recalled that, at a
meeting held on 21 March 2001, Mr. Jilani informed him that Bayindir would "never
bring in the rest of that equipment" (Bridger's WS, 78). In his Supplemental Witness
Statement, Mr. Bridger testified that he had found this statement "quite shocking"
(Bridger's Supplemental WS, 110), which he confirmed orally (Tr. M., 29 May 2008.
259, 5-18):

"Well, | think the very misguided view that Mr. Jilani gave of the obstructions,
and the progress, certainly | was very disappointed in, and in fact, so much so
that | made a point of convening a meeting with Mr. Jilani and others very soon
after that March 19" meeting to discuss the importation of plant to get the
Project really moving again, and it was in that meeting, | think it might have
been just two days after the presentation on the 19", that | was absolutely
flabbergasted that there was no intention by Bayindir to bring in plant that |
understood was due to come in accordance with a 1998 agreement with NHA,
and | just thought it was trickery taken to the Nth degree.”

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 259, 5-18)

 

The oral testimony of Mr. Jilani appeared to confirm Mr. Bridger's statement that
Bayindir did not intend to bring in additional equipment. Asked in redirect examination
whether the equipment that Bayindir had on site was insufficient, Mr. Jilani gave a long
answer to the effect that Bayindir was not contractually required to bring in more
equipment (Tr. M., 27 May 2008, 81-85).

Additional criticism was voiced both by the Engineer's Representative and by the
Employer shortly before the issuance of the sub-clause 63.1(b)(ii) notice on 19 April
2001. On 14 April 2001, Mr. Bridger in particular reminded Bayindir that:

"According to any assessment, your rate of progress has remained well below
the Contract requirements and you have failed to comply with our notice
issued to you under Clause 46.1."

(Exh. [Pak.] RB-69)

Accordingly, the facts are such that NHA's concerns about Bayindir's performance
must be deemed founded, with the result that NHA was entitled to consider termination.
Under these circumstances, the Tribunal can see no basis for finding a breach of the
applicable FET standard.

In the light of the foregoing conclusion, the Tribunal will dispense with reviewing
whether one or more of the three reasons invoked by the Claimant are capable of
grounding an allegation of governmental interference with the Contract.

Did Pakistan exert illegitimate pressure or coercion on Bayindir?
Bayindir's position

It is Bayindir's case that it was expelled from the site under threat by armed soldiers
who had surrounded the site on 24 April 2001 and prevented Bayindir's personnel from
entering their offices or removing records (Mem. M.. 179). Bayindir emphasizes that
the time and manner in which the notice of expulsion was served upon Bayindir was
deliberately planned so as to prevent Bayindir from seeking assistance or advice from
its head office, or the Turkish Embassy in Islamabad, or legal counsel (Mem. M.. {
102). In this regard, Bayindir quotes from Pope & Talbot v. Canada®’ and argues that a
"confrontational and aggressive" regulatory review may breach fair and equitable
treatment:

"The relations between the SLD and the Investment during 1999 were more
like combat than cooperative regulation, and the Tribunal finds that the SLD
bears the overwhelming responsibility for this state of affairs. It is not for the
Tribunal to discern the motivations behind the attitude of the SLD; however the
end result for the Investment was being subjected to threats, denied its
reasonable requests for pertinent information, required to incur unnecessary
expense and disruption in meeting SLD's requests for information, forced to
expend legal fees and probably suffer loss of reputation in government
circles.[...] In its totality, the SLD's treatment of the Investment during 1999 in
relation to the verification review process is nothing less than a denial of the
fair treatment required by NAFTA Article 1105, and the Tribunal finds Canada
liable to the Investor for the resultant damages."”*

Bayindir opposes Pakistan's allegation that the security problems on site were caused
by unpaid subcontractors. It asserts that it had paid its subcontractors for the works
performed until the end of December 2000 and that non-payment for works performed

thereafter was due to NHA's failure to settle outstanding IPCs. According to Bayindir,
the Chairman of NHA, in a press conference of 23 April 2001, upon the expulsion of

Pope & Talbot Inc v. The Government of Canada NAFTA Arbitration (UNCITRAL Rules), Award
of 10 April 2001 (hereafter, Pope & Talbot v. Canada).

Id., § 181, quoted in Mem. M., § 181.

93

318.

319.

321.

Bayindir, assured Bayindir's subcontractors that their interests would be protected
Exh. [Bay.] CX-93). However, upon a request by Bayindir that its subcontractors be
paid by NHA directly out of the certified amounts payable to Bayindir, the Engineer
issued an allegedly biased decision under sub-clause 67.1, rejecting direct payment.
Thus, Pakistan refused to pay Bayindir's subcontractors and directed the
subcontractors to approach Bayindir for payment, which the latter did with the result
that Bayindir's personnel was threatened and felt extremely insecure.

Moreover, Bayindir alleges that the Respondent deployed the FWO, a unit of the army,
on the site. Thus, as a result of Pakistan's acts and omissions, Bayindir's expatriate
personnel was compelled to leave Pakistan without securing its assets and property
(Reply M., {1 242 - 243, Exh. [Pak.] CM-61, Exh. [Bay.] CX-158, CX-159).

Bayindir further claims that it was entitled under the Contract to seek a decision under
sub-clause 67.1, followed by final adjudication by an arbitral tribunal. While such
remedy was being pursued, the Respondent could not lawfully take over the site (Mem.
M., 4104). Bayindir has also mentioned that recourse to arbitration by the Respondent
may constitute an act of coercion in breach of the FET standard as characterized in
Tecmed (Mem. M., 183).

Pakistan's position

Pakistan's position is that the expulsion was carried out in accordance with the
Contract. In particular, there was no intimidation of Bayindir's personnel. Neither was
there any contemporaneous complaint by Bayindir, not even with respect to NHA's
decision to use FWO personnel to secure the site and protect the equipment left by
Bayindir (C.-Mem M., {1 4.42). Pakistan further argues that coercion as such, i.e.
irrespective of any unlawful conduct, cannot give rise to an actionable breach of the
FET standard (C.-Mem. M., 14.43).

In Pakistan's view, Bayindir's allegation of forcible expulsion comprises two elements (i)
alleged coercive acts and threats by Pakistani armed soldiers; and (ii) alleged
confiscation of records. In Pakistan's submission, Bayindir has failed to prove these
elements. Bayindir relies heavily on Mr. Sadik Can's witness statement, who, as noted
by Pakistan, was not in a position to recall what happened at the time of expulsion

94

322.

323.

324.

325.

because he had left the site on 25 April 2001, two days after receipt of the expulsion
notice, and therefore was not present when the actual expulsion took place on 7 May
2001. Apart from Mr. Can's testimony, Bayindir has failed to substantiate its
allegations. In particular, no complaints were raised at the time by any of Bayindir's
representatives about coercion, threats or mistreatment at the hands of Pakistan.

According to Pakistan, security concerns that existed on site after Bayindir's expulsion
had nothing to do with Pakistani armed soldiers, but were due to Bayindir's failure to
pay its employees and subcontractors (PHB [Pak.] {| 4.1-4.3). NHA's response in
arranging extra police protection and the FWO's presence were necessary to protect
the site, including the equipment and Bayindir's personnel during the handing over of
the Project to NHA (Rej. M. 3.91 — 3.124). In this connection, Pakistan notes that
payment to subcontractors was the sole responsibility of Bayindir, as there was no
privity of contract between NHA and Bayindir's subcontractors. In issuing the directions
ruling out direct payment by NHA, the Engineer acted in conformity with his duties (Rej.
M., 99. 2.68-2.70).

Pakistan also notes that Bayindir points to no authority supporting that a State entity's
recourse to an arbitration mechanism agreed in a contract can be considered as an act

of coercion (C.-Mem. M., 74.44).
Tribunal's determination

The main evidentiary source of Bayindir's allegation is the witness statement of
Mr. Sadik Can, President of Bayindir Construction Company (Exh. [Bay.] CX-65). The
Tribunal must therefore assess Mr. Can's testimony and weigh it in the light of the other
evidence in the record.

In his written statement, Mr. Can mentioned that in the evening of 23 April 2001, he
was handed a letter which required Bayindir to vacate the site within 14 days and was
urged to acknowledge receipt of this letter, which he did under protest. He further
testified that he "noticed some soldiers of the Pakistani Army who were carrying guns
and had taken positions at the gates and were also seen walking on the site" and that
"[t]he presence of soldiers resulted in a panic amongst [his] staff who felt that they may
be taken into custody or subjected to physical abuse" (Can's WS. 6-7). Mr. Can

95

326.

327.

added that the office site was locked, that the entrance was guarded by an armed
soldier, and that he and his staff were only allowed to enter the office by the soldier
who had the key, and that they were prevented from removing or copying any files.
Mr. Can left Pakistan shortly thereafter reaching Turkey on 25 April 2001 (Can's WS,
Q). At the hearing, he declared that:

"On the evening of the 23°, once we received the Notice, we were obviously —
we found ourselves obviously in a very tight corner. The people at the site
and | sat down. We thought about what we could do. Meanwhile, while we
were talking, we realised that there were uniformed and armed soldiers on
site. When we saw the soldiers we said, 'Okay, this is very serious’. We felt
we needed to secure our offices on site. We also felt we needed to secure
ourselves. This was something we were not quite familiar with. We had been
in Pakistan for four to five years until then, and until then we had our own
security forces that maintained security. This is a security force composed of
professionals. We saw soldiers, and obviously this caused further unrest.
Everyone, including myself, was scared. | was obviously leading the Project
so | had to calm my colleagues down. | tried to calm them down. My
colleagues and | said that we need to take our personal belongings and
important valuables from the offices. We went to our offices but we were
unable to access the offices. The soldiers came to us and they said that we
cannot take anything out of the offices.”

(Tr. M., 27 May 2008, 247-248, 3-25, 1).

This account sounds quite dramatic. The fear and unrest among Bayindir's personnel
is easily understandable and cannot be taken lightly. Yet, upon a closer review of the
specific facts, the situation loses much of its drama. In reality, there are no indications
that Bayindir's staff were threatened or subjected to physical violence by conduct
attributable to the Respondent. To the contrary, the Respondent took steps to maintain
order on the site and to protect Bayindir's staff from potential harm by the unpaid local
workers hired by Bayindir. In fact, the main threat against Bayindir's personnel
emanated from unpaid local workers and was handled by means of a non-fighting unit
of the Pakistani army, the two, usually deployed for such tasks.

At the hearing, counsel for the Respondent asked Mr. Can several times whether he
could point to any specific security complaint by Bayindir's staff in Pakistan. Mr. Can's
answer was that he did not know (Tr. M., 27 May 2008, 268, 7-25, 272-273, 24-25, 1-
9). Mr. Bridger's testimony reports the absence of security concerns. He had "not
heard mention of any violence or rough tactics being used by anyone from NHA or from
Fwo" in his discussions with local staff (Bridger's WS. 4 108). Mr. Bridger further
testified that he held a meeting with the Employer and Bayindir after the expulsion
notice was served, and advised them of the steps that had to be taken for the orderly

96

328.

329.

330.

expulsion of Bayindir (Bridger's WS, 104). He then confirmed the main content of this
meeting in a letter of 24 April 2001 (Exh. [Pak.] CM-127). As noted by the Respondent,
the letter makes no mention of any complaints regarding harassment or coercion by
armed forces. With respect to security, it merely states that Bayindir was responsible
for the security of the site for a period of two weeks.

Mr. Bridger also recalled that after the issuance of the notice of expulsion

"large gatherings of angry people unpaid by BCI took place at the Burhan
Camp and at BCI's offices in Islamabad. These crowds wanted to be paid
before BCI left Pakistan. | remember that on one occasion the BCI Project
Manager was trapped in his office on site by a mob of people [ ... ] |
understand that he was extricated through the efforts of NHA without being
harmed."

(Bridger's WS, 4106).

This view of the situation immediately after expulsion is confirmed by a letter of 26 April
2001 from Askari Guards (PVT) Ltd., the security firm which Bayindir had hired to
secure the site. That letter states that "the contractors and employees who have not
been paid their dues are likely to react violently" and that the situation may require
“special assistance [ ... ] from law enforcing agencies" (Exh. [Pak.] R-24). This view
was reinforced by the oral testimony of General Javed, who declared that:

"The Escri(?) [Askari] Guards were already there, and | have seen it
somewhere on the record that the Escri [Askari] Guard had written a letter to
Bayindir that, 'Unless you supplement our resources, get outside help,
additional help, we cannot guarantee the safety of your people’, but before
such a letter, | was conscious that here are nearly 70 or 75 plus Turkish staff,
and they would be in jeopardy if we didn't try to save their life and property.
The reason was that the — there was a lot of restlessness amongst the low
level employees and the low level-one-concerns-type people, and most of
them happened to be from the turbulent tribal areas of Pakistan, the Burhans
who usually get very angry, et cetera, and can resort to any level of violence
when their wages for the last six months are not paid, so | thought it was my
responsibility to make sure that the process of expulsion and other related
post-expulsion and post-termination events take place in a most organized
manner."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 142-143, 24-25, 1-18).

At the hearing, Mr. Sadik Can did not offer any alternative explanation (Tr. M., 27 May
2008, 263-265). Asked whether he was aware of the warning contained in the letter

 

from Askari Guards, Mr. Can stated "No. | was not aware of it, and | did not infer from
Article 3 that additional support would be needed. | read in paragraph 3 that difficulties

may arise because of unpaid salaries" (Tr. M.. 27 May 2008. 264, 5-8). Bayindir
contends that NHA should have paid its subcontractors out of the certified amounts

97

331.

332.

333.

payable to Bayindir instead of directing these subcontractors to Bayindir. However, the
Claimant has not established that NHA actually sought to turn the subcontractors
against Bayindir in order to coerce the latter, nor has it demonstrated that NHA was
responsible for paying Bayindir's subcontractors.

The expulsion was effected on 7 May 2001, at a time when Mr. Can was no longer in
Pakistan. Mr. Bridger was not on site either when the Employer took over. The
operation was reportedly performed by FWO on behalf of the Employer. According to
the testimonies of Mr. Bridger and General Javed, the FWO is the construction and
engineering unit of Pakistan's army and was used to secure and protect the equipment
and material left on the site (Bridger's WS, 4 107; Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 143, 20-25).
General Javed testified that there were approximately twenty to twenty-five men of the
FWO, in addition to the guards hired by Bayindir, and that the FWO were deployed
"because they are familiar with the job, and they had a number of contracts from NHA
also" (Tr. M.. 29 May 2008. 143-144. 25-2). General Javed further explained that
“when this happened, not one person was even scratched, not a pin was stolen, and
there was absolute order when the expulsion process took place" (Tr. M., 29 May 2008.
144, 5-8).

Thereafter, in response to a letter from Mr. Bridger of 7 May 2001, Bayindir identified
the personnel which would carry out the joint measurement of the remaining permanent
works, temporary works, and preparation of inventories as required by the Contract
(Exh. [Pak.] CM-136). On this occasion, Bayindir raised no complaints as to any
mistreatment of personnel by NHA's security staff. The letter only stated that "Bayindir
Security shall work in parallel with NHA's additional security arrangements until
complete handing/taking over of the Project takes place" (Exh. [Pak.] CM-136). The
same day, Mr. Bridger answered Bayindir's letter stressing that "[u]nder the Contract it
is only appropriate to have Bayindir Security personnel on hand as observers" (Exh.
Pak.] CM-137).

The minutes of the first joint measurement and inventory meeting, held on 10 May
2001, at which three representatives of Bayindir were present, do not record any
complaints about harassment or coercion either (Exh. [Pak.] CM-138). At a meeting
held the following day, Bayindir expressed the concern that the FWO may have a

98

334.

335.

336.

conflict of interest in the measurement and inventory process and stressed its
preference for engaging some other independent organisation with the necessary
expertise (Exh. [Pak.] CM-141). No complaints about mistreatment were raised in this
context either. By letter of 15 May 2001, Mr. Bridger advised Bayindir that an
independent organisation, Jaffer Brothers (Pvt.) Ltd., had been nominated to conduct
the joint inventory (Exh. [Pak.] CM-142).

By contrast, Bayindir did raise complaints on 16 May 2001 with respect to the taking
over by NHA of the sites, offices, workshops and stores at the Burhan and Bara Banda
camps, noting that "[pJolice was mobilized at all end and entry points and thus all the
camps and sites were sealed on the same day" (Exh. [Pak.] CM-143). On 21 May
2001, Bayindir also complained about a one day shutdown of electricity that had taken
place at its residential block on 17 May 2001; it added that such actions were "contrary
to the agreement to speed up the inventorization and other important activities" (Exh.
Pak.] CM-144). Mr. Bridger replied on 24 May 2001 that he did not condone such
actions, but that NHA had "the legal right to take over any or all parts of the site that
they wish" and that, upon raising the matter, he had been assured that the process
would be completed in a "professional manner" (Exh. [Pak.] CM-145). Two days later,
Mr. Bridger wrote that access to offices and stores had been restricted for one or two
days at the beginning of the inventory period, and that the issue relating to the removal
of some of Bayindir's records had been solved amicably (Exh. [Pak.] RB-105).

Regarding Bayindir's access to files more generally, Mr. Bridger testified that records
were kept "under a dual lock system requiring attendance for access by both NHA and
BCI" (Bridger's supplemental WS, { 122) and that, although there were tensions
between the parties, he was generally able to achieve cooperation. He did not recall
“ever being made aware of any occasion where BCI had been unable to resolve
problems of access to any records at the Project Site Offices, when such access was
necessary for the supply of information to NHA" (Bridger's supplemental WS, 4 123).

On the basis of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence
does not support Bayindir's allegation of coercion. There is no evidence showing that
Bayindir was harassed or coerced by conduct of NHA or of its subcontractors
attributable to the Respondent. Nor is there any evidence showing that NHA or the

99

337.

(iv)

338.

339.

Respondent failed to act when it appeared necessary to prevent harm to Bayindir's
personnel. Quite to the contrary, the few instances in which Bayindir raised complaints
about the treatment of its personnel appear to have been swiftly addressed and would
in any event not be capable as such of sustaining a breach of the FET standard.

Finally, the Tribunal is also unpersuaded by the Claimant's allegation that the recourse
to arbitration under the Contract constitutes an exercise of coercion or undue pressure.
Bayindir has not provided any explanation, nor any authority to this effect. It appears
obvious to the Tribunal that, as a rule, a party's initiation of arbitration as provided in a
contract cannot constitute a treaty breach.

Was Bayindir deprived of due process and/or procedural fairness?

Bayindir's position

It is Bayindir's claim that it was denied its right to be heard and was treated in a non
transparent manner because all the decisions affecting its investment were taken at the
highest level without it being heard (Mem. M., { 190: Reply M., 297). Bayindir relies
on Metalclad v. Mexico,®° Middle East Cement v. Egypt,°° Tecmed v. Mexico,*' and
Waste Management v. Mexico. In Bayindir's submission, these awards hold that the
absence of a fair procedure or the existence of serious procedural shortcomings may
constitute violations of fair and equitable treatment.

In Bayindir's submission, delays and disputes are common in large construction
projects. Thus, Pakistan should have worked in good faith towards a resolution as
required by the FET standard and held in Saluka v. Czech Republic. Instead,
Pakistan "exercised a destructive option to which it was not even contractually entitled
— expulsion" (PHB [Bay.] 4.65).

340.

341.

342.

343.

344.

In any case, Bayindir emphasizes that the dispute resolution provisions of the Contract
are irrelevant, as the present claims are brought under the Treaty and are therefore
distinct from contract claims.

Pakistan's position

For Pakistan, Bayindir's contentions assume some form of administrative or analogous
proceedings where due process requirements apply. However, this case does not
involve any such proceedings. Rather, Bayindir failed to perform under the Contract,
which resulted in discussions at various levels as to the consequences of that breach
(C.-Mem. M., 4.45).

Moreover, Bayindir had the opportunity and did in fact meet and make representations
to high level governmental officials at the main junctures when the Project was in crisis.
Such representations were taken into account in NHA's final decision to expel Bayindir
(C.-Mem. M., 994.47 - 4.48).

Tribunal's determination

The Tribunal must determine whether the due process requirements that could be
derived from the applicable FET standard cover situations such as the present one, in
which procedural fairness was allegedly denied because the Claimant was not part of
the internal decision-making of the administration concerning the management of the
Contract. If so, the Tribunal must then assess whether the Claimant was in fact denied
procedural fairness.

The Tribunal agrees with the arbitral decisions holding that a denial of due process or
procedural fairness may amount to a breach of the FET standard. This does not

See, for instance, S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada, NAFTA Arbitration (UNCITRAL
Rules), Partial Award of 13 November 2000 (hereafter, S.D. Myers v. Canada); Mondev v.
United States, supra footnote60; ADF v. United States, supra footnote 61, Loewen Group v.
United States, supra footnote 76, Middle East Cement v. Egypt, supra footnote 90.

101

345.

346.

347.

mean, however, that such guarantees are available in any given situation. As noted in
Waste Management, to which the Claimant refers, whilst the fair and equitable
treatment standard may be infringed by conduct amounting to "a complete lack of
transparency and candour in an administrative process," such standard largely
depends upon and must be adapted to the circumstances of each specific case.°%° The
decisions which address this issue, generally do so in the context of judicial or
administrative proceedings. Such was, for instance, the case in Metalclad and
Tecmed. As for Middle East Cement, the procedural fairness requirement was applied
to seizure and auction procedures, which can also be deemed administrative in nature.

The nature of the present issue is different. It deals with the internal decisions of NHA
and the government regarding the management of the Contract. Public administrations
are regularly involved in managing different types of contracts and act, in this regard, in
a manner which is not fundamentally different from that in which a private corporation
handles its contractual relationships. Such internal processes may include decisions
required to perform contractual obligations, such as planning and releasing budgetary
allocations or carrying out performance reviews. The Tribunal is aware that, in certain
respects, public and private contracting are not subject to the same requirements. A
typical example is the tendering processes related to public procurement contracts.

This said, the Tribunal considers that, under the present circumstances, the decision of
NHA, in consultation with the government, to resort to certain contractual remedies and
the related preparatory discussions and assessments were not as such subject to
procedural requirements other than those contractually agreed. In this connection, the
Tribunal has concluded, in paragraphs 240-258 and 281-314 supra, that the main
contractual mechanisms which eventually led to the expulsion of Bayindir (particularly
the issuance of notices under sub-clauses 46.1 and 63.1(b)(ii)) had not been used in a
manner that amounts to a breach of the Treaty. In particular, there is no evidence that
the Engineer or the Engineer's Representative were biased and deprived Bayindir of
procedural safeguards.

More importantly, even assuming for the sake of the analysis that due process and
procedural fairness govern the internal processes underlying the exercise of

102

348.

e.

1.

349.

contractual rights, the record shows that Bayindir was indeed given the opportunity to
present its position on numerous occasions throughout the relevant period. In this
regard, the Respondent has pointed to the following instances: representations to a
committee formed by the Ministry of Communications (14/12/99) (Exh. [Pak.] CM-174);
representations to a meeting chaired by the Secretary of Communications (19/01/00)
(Exh. [Pak.] CM-175); discussions among Bayindir's President and the Chairman of
NHA, the Secretary General of Finance, the Secretary of Communications, and the
Engineer (09/02/00) (Exh. [Pak.] CM-176); letter from Bayindir's Chairman to President
Musharraf acknowledging that several meetings had taken place between Bayindir and
NHA, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Finance (26/02/00) (Exh.
Pak.] CM-177); shortly thereafter invitation of the Turkish Ambassador to Pakistan by
the Chairman of NHA to participate in a meeting between the parties, which later led to
the signature of Addendum No. 9 (Exh. [Pak.] CM-178); meeting between the Turkish
Ambassador and the Chairman of NHA (19//12/00) (Exh. [Pak.] CM-182, CM-183);
letter from the Minister of Communications to the Turkish Ambassador to inform him of
Bayindir's defective performance (20/02/01) (Exh. [Pak.] CM-179); letters from the
President of Bayindir to the Turkish Ambassador referring to a previous meeting with
the Chairman of NHA and Minister of Communications and requesting him to arrange
another meeting (26/02/01) (Exh. [Pak.] CM-180), which was done (Exh. [Pak.] CM-
181, CM-182); meeting attended by representatives of the Ministries of

 

Communications, of Finance, and Foreign affairs, as well as by a Senior Diplomat from
the Turkish Embassy, the parties and the Engineer (19/03/01) (Exh. [Pak.] CM-97).

In summary, the Tribunal concludes that Bayindir was not denied due process or
procedural fairness primarily because these requirements did not apply in the present
context. Secondarily, assuming — quod non — that they applied, the record shows that
Bayindir was in fact afforded a number of opportunities to present its position during the
relevant time period.

Conduct following the expulsion

Bayindir's position

Bayindir alleges that after the expulsion Pakistan failed to proceed to the evaluation of
the works completed pursuant to sub-clause 63.2 of the Contract or to certify IPAs 22

103

350.

351.

352.

and 23. In Bayindir's submission, Pakistan slashed IPAs 22 and 23 to a fraction of their
original value and failed to pay IPCs 20 and 21, which had been certified by the
Engineer and were due and payable to the Claimant in March 2001, namely before its
expulsion. Moreover, the Respondent refused to certify an extension of time granted
by the Engineer (EOT 04) and claimed some US$ 1 billion in the Pakistani arbitration.

Pakistan's position

It is Pakistan's argument that Bayindir retains residual rights under clause 63 of the
Contract (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 128, 6-10). In particular, NHA did not pay IPCs 20 and
21 because these IPCs were not payable under the Contract until the final accounting
at the end of the Project's Defects Liability Period (PHB [Pak.] § 3.2). NHA's
participation in the measuring up exercise following Bayindir's expulsion evidences its

 

intention to comply with the final accounting provision. In any case, Bayindir has not
established that NHA did not intend to apply sub-clause 63.3 at the end of the Defects
Liability Period (Rej. M., 13.128).

Tribunal's determination

It was not until its post-hearing submission that the Claimant clearly identified that the
"conduct following the expulsion" allegedly in breach of the FET standard consisted of
“unfair and inequitable" actions in connection with the handling of IPA 23 (PHB [Bay.]
86), the lack of certification and payment of IPA 22 (PHB [Bay.] 4 87), and "Pakistan's
self-serving and litigation-motivated reductions to the values of both IPA 22 and IPA
23" (PHB [Bay.] 88). These acts are said to be unfair and inequitable because they
do not comply with the Contract and, more fundamentally, because they reflect the

 

intention of the Respondent not to abide by clause 63 and therefore deprive Bayindir of
any remaining contractual rights.

It is recalled that the task of the Tribunal is not to exercise jurisdiction over contractual

matters but to assess whether the alleged conduct is established and, if so, whether it
amounts to a breach of the Treaty.

It is undisputed that NHA did not pay IPCs 20 and 21. It also arises from the record
that IPAs 22 and 23 have not been certified, that they have been reduced over time,
and that NHA has not approved the extension of time calculated by the Engineer in
response to EOT 04 (Exh. [Pak.] RB-84). The Claimant has further stressed that the
Engineer and its Representative did not certify the works as required under sub-clause
63.2 of the Contract within the context of the final settlement of accounts contemplated
under sub-clause 63.3 of the Contract. In his oral testimony, Mr. Bridger stated that he
did not recall whether he or the Engineer had issued such certification (Tr. M., 29 May
2008, 237, 7-14).

The Parties provide conflicting interpretations of whether or not such conduct was in
breach of the Contract. The Respondent notes, inter alia, that:

“once it was established that there was no immediate right to payment due to
the issuance of the expulsion notice, the urgency of preparing the IPCs was
removed, i.e. the question of what sums were owing to Bayindir was
postponed until the time of the final measure up pursuant to Clause 63.3 of the
Contract."

(PHB [Pak.] 7.25)

The Claimant argues that a number of steps had to be followed for the process of final
settlement of accounts to be completed, and that NHA and the Engineer or the
Engineer's Representative failed to take some of these steps, which amounted to a
breach of the Contract. It seeks to infer from these facts the existence of an intent to
deprive it in an unfair and inequitable manner of any residual rights it may have under
sub-clause 63.3 of the Contract.

In light of the evidence, the Tribunal is not convinced by Bayindir's allegation for
several reasons. First, the Respondent's expert Mr. Chapman has provided a
reasonable contractual explanation of NHA's acts in respect of the treatment of IPCs 20
and 21:

"Sub-Clause 63.3 provides that upon expulsion the Employer's obligation to
pay monies to the Contractor is suspended until the expiration of the Defects
Liability Period at the earliest. This means that all payments to the Contractor
are instantly frozen. No further certification need be undertaken by the
Engineer in respect of Interim Payment Applications (whether submitted
before of (sic) after the expulsion) and any certificates issued to the Employer
by the Engineer in respect of payments due to the Contractor are not to be
paid."

(Chapman's WS, { 42)

357.

358.

359.

~

360.

The Claimant's expert Mr. Pickavance offered no specific alternative interpretation of
the Contract to counter this.

Second, the evidence discussed in paragraphs 332-335 supra shows that NHA did in
fact engage in a measurement and inventory process as required by sub-clause 63.2 of
the Contract. In that context, it took account of Bayindir's concerns about FWO's bias
(Exh. [Pak.] CM-141) with the result that an independent organization was put in
charge of the joint inventory (Exh. [Pak.] CM-142). That organization reportedly
completed its task on 13 May 2003 (Exh. [Pak.] R-68).

Third, Mr. Bridger has testified that, despite some tensions, a good level of cooperation
was generally achieved, and that he did not recall “ever being made aware of any
occasion where BCI had been unable to resolve problems of access to any records at
the Project Site Offices, when such access was necessary for the supply of information
to NHA" (Bridger's supplemental WS, { 123).

In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the acts identified by
Bayindir amount to a breach of the Treaty.

Attempted encashment of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees

Bayindir's position

Bayindir submits that Pakistan inequitably and unfairly ruined the Bayindir Group by
calling the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees without a contractual basis, the
contractual justifications put forward by Pakistan (analogy with sub-clause 60.8 of the
Contract as well as paragraph 3 of sub-clause 60.8 in Addendum No. 6) being ill-
founded. Indeed, according to Bayindir, sub-clause 60.8 had been contractually
superseded twice.°%®

In June 1999, this mechanism was replaced with a rollover system if the amount of a given
month's Mobilisation Advance deduction exceeded the amount due to Bayindir under a
particular IPC, the difference due to Pakistan would be carried forward and deducted from the
next IPC. Second, in Addendum No. 9, the fixed Mobilisation Advance repayment schedule
was replaced by a percentage deduction from each IPC, as a result of which the Mobilisation
Advance deduction would always be a percentage of Bayindir's IPC payment, and could never
exceed the IPC payment due to Bayindir.

106

361.

362.

363.

364.

Bayindir also stresses that the Respondent's alleged contractual justifications are new,
as the argument that the Mobilisation Advance was only allowed to be used for the
purchase of permanently imported equipment, implying that Pakistan was entitled to
recover any amounts spent on mobilization with temporarily imported equipment, was
advanced for the first time at the hearing. Furthermore, this argument was said not to
take into account that sub-clause 60.8 in Addendum No. 6 provides that there would be
no bank guarantee for the 20% Mobilisation Advance which was to be utilized for the
purchase of plant and equipment. In addition, the link between plant and equipment
and the Mobilisation Advance was later superseded. The Over-Riding Conditions of
Contract provided that the Mobilisation Advance — increased to 30% — would be
secured by letters of guarantee from a bank and from Bayindir. This provision was
then further modified by NHA's Letter of Acceptance, which confirmed that the
Mobilisation Advance would amount to 30%, the full amount being secured by a bank
guarantee (PHB [Bay.] {1 95-106).

It is Bayindir's further submission that the attempt to encash the guarantees not only
lacked a contractual basis but was also unfair, if not even in bad faith. In support,
Bayindir refers to NHA's request of 7 April 2001 that Bayindir renew the Mobilisation
Advance Guarantees expiring on 9 May 2001. This request came shortly before
Bayindir's expulsion and only days after the Ministries of Communications and Finance
had decided, unbeknownst to Bayindir, to halt all payments for the Project and to
request a decision on the future of the Project from General Musharraf.

In addition, Bayindir asserts that the encashment would unjustly enrich Pakistan to the
extent that Bayindir left behind the product of the Mobilisation Advance on the site, and
brought about the complete collapse of the Bayindir Group given the circumstances
surrounding the attempted encashment, the magnitude of the bank guarantees and the
fact that these were provided by a consortium consisting of all of the major Turkish
banks, thus cutting off Bayindir's access to credit and financing.

Finally, Bayindir notes that Pakistan sought to encash the guarantees at their full face
value, without first deducting the value of repayments due under IPCs 20 and 21.

Pakistan's position

107

365.

366.

367.

368.

369.

In substance, Pakistan asserts that the call on the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees
was made in accordance with the Contract. The position of the Respondent is
supported by the expert testimony of Mr. Chapman (Chapman's WS, 4 50; Chapman's
Supplemental WS. 60-64). According to the latter's evidence, the call complied with
sub-clause 60.8 and any benefits accruing to the Employer from it would be taken into
account in the final accounts. As a result, any allegation of bad faith would be doomed
to fail.

The Respondent also contends that Bayindir did not spend the Mobilisation Advance
as contractually required. It refers to Bayindir's financial difficulties and argues that a
substantial part of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantee (US$ 35 million) was likely
used for purposes unrelated to the M-1 Project, as suggested by the testimony of
Mr. Cértik, Chairman of Bayindir Holding Company, before a Turkish Parliamentary
Committee set up to investigate the sale of Turkbank (PHB [Pak.] {413.107 — 3.121).

Tribunal's determination

It is common ground that NHA sought to encash the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees.
As discussed in section IV(A)(b) supra, this conduct can be attributed to the
Respondent, which the latter did not dispute. The Tribunal must thus determine
whether the attempted encashment of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees
constitutes a breach of FET.

The Parties disagree on whether the attempted encashment of the Mobilisation
Advance Guarantees was in conformity with the Contract. The main point of
disagreement is whether sub-clause 60.8 of the Contract provides a basis for the
encashment.

Sub-clause 60.8 entitles the Employer to call the guarantees to the extent the amount
due by Bayindir as reimbursement of the Mobilisation Advance exceeds the amount
due to Bayindir for work done. The mechanism for the recovery of advance payments
was amended twice. First, on 24 June 1999 (Exh. [Bay.] C-16) to the effect that "[t]he
recovery/deduction of the advance payment shall be made from every IPC irrespective
of its value beginning from the IPC of May 1999 onward. In the event that the value of
any monthly deduction/recovery exceeds the amount of any particular IPC, the

108

370.

371.

372.

difference in amount will be carried forward and adjusted from the next IPC and so on"
(Exh. [Bay.] C-16). Second, in Article 3 of Addendum No. 9, which replaced the fixed
repayment schedule with a percentage deduction from each IPC (Exh. [Bay.] C-18).

Bayindir submits that, as a result of these two amendments, the content of sub-clause
60.8 became inoperative and that the repayment of the Mobilisation Advance should in
any event have been frozen until final settlement (PHB [Bay.] § 102). Pakistan
responds by reference to the first expert report of Mr. Chapman according to whom:

"In the situation where a contractor is expelled before the advance payments
have been recovered in full (and thus the APG is extant) | would expect the
Employer to make a call on the bond in order to recover as much of the
advance payment as possible. Clause 60.8 of the Contract provides that the
Contractor is obliged to repay amounts of mobilisation payments in excess of
monies certified within seven days of demand and if not paid the Employer
shall be empowered to call in sufficient of the APG to cover this balance. The
APG is security for a loan and once the Contractor is expelled, no further
payments from which the loan repayments are to be deducted will be made.
Accordingly, | believe the right under Clause 60.8 to demand recovery of the
loan crystallises once expulsion occurs."

(Chapman's WS, { 50)

In his additional report, Mr. Chapman added the following:

"The Mobilisation Bond is 'on demand’ and its execution is not dependent
upon proof of fault by the Contractor nor is the operation of this bond deferred
until the time of the Final Statement. The provision of on demand bonds is an
onerous obligation placed on a contractor but one that has been found
necessary within the construction industry to avoid the bondsman (or an
arbitrator or the court) being required to determine liability for breach of
performance by the Contractor which, with a resistant contractor, could take a
considerable time. However, it is accepted that the Employer is not to use its
right to demand payment without due cause and an implied term to this effect
is recognised. That said, as long as the Employer has a genuine belief that
the advance payment is not to be repaid in accordance with the terms of the
Contract and that the Contractor is unable to complete its obligations under
the Contract, | consider that a call on the Mobilisation Bond is justified."

(Chapman's Supplemental WS, { 63)

The Claimant's expert Mr. Pickavance offered no specific alternative interpretation of
the Contract to counter this.

The Respondent further argues that Bayindir improperly spent the Mobilisation
Advance on temporarily imported equipment as well as on matters unrelated to the M-1
Project. In this latter regard, it referred to a statement of Mr. Cértiik, Chairman of
Bayindir Holding Company, before a Turkish Parliamentary Committee set up to

109

373.

374.

375.

investigate the sale of Turkbank. In response to a question regarding the source of the
funds used by Bayindir to acquire a TV station, Genc TV station, Mr. Cértik stated:

"We are a group (of Companies) having a monthly turnover of 70-80 million
dollars. Namely if we obtain the loans or resources from other places, for
instance in those days — if | remember this correctly exactly-we, in fact,
obtained the money amounted to 30-40,000,000 dollars from Pakistan."
(Annex 24 to WS of Dr. Birsel, submitted with Resp RP).

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal can see no Treaty breach. The Parties have
divergent views about the interpretation and application of subclause 60.8 of the
Contract. Pakistan puts forward an interpretation that is reasonable and is supported
by expert evidence. [Even if such interpretation were not to prevail in a contract
arbitration, the related conduct would not rise to the level of a violation of the Treaty
standards.

This said, relying on the sequence of events, the Claimant alleges bad faith on the part
of Pakistan. If this allegation were founded, it would be capable of changing the
conclusion just reached. Specifically, Bayindir claims that the request for the renewal
of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees, which were to expire on 9 April 2001, was
made on 7 April 2001, that is:

"shortly before Bayindir's expulsion, and only days after the Ministries of
Communications and Finance had decided, unbeknownst to Bayindir, to halt
all funds for the Project and request General Musharraf's decision on the
future of the Project."

(PHB [Bay.] 1.97)

The Claimant further observes that "a mere three weeks" after Bayindir renewed the
guarantees in full, Pakistan sought to encash them.

The Claimant seeks to infer bad faith from its reading of the chronology. There is,
however, no evidence showing bad faith. Even if it were established that Pakistan
requested the renewal for the sole purpose of calling the guarantees shortly thereafter,
this fact would not suffice in and of itself to demonstrate bad faith. Indeed, as a general
matter, it would rather appear as good contract management to renew guarantees
when they are about to expire and the liabilities secured by such guarantees are still
likely to materialize. This was precisely so here. The Respondent contends that it tried
to collect on the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees in order to recover as much of the
advance payment as possible, Bayindir having failed to mobilize the contractually

110

376.

377.

378.

379.

g-

380.

required equipment on site. The discussion of the evidence in paragraphs 308-314
supra, shows that, even after the issuance of the sub-clause 46.1 notice in December
2000, Bayindir did not bring the adequate equipment to the site. This point was in
particular stressed by Mr. Bridger at the hearing.

"Q: So a reasonable Contractor (sic) [client] would be happy to see that efforts
were being made to bring it behind schedule, and to bring it on schedule?

A: Substantial efforts, and real efforts. Not just bringing in equipment that
didn't have the capacity to achieve the production levels, you know, we saw a
lot of increases in equipment after that Notice was served, but the productivity
fell, despite the increase in numbers of items of equipment.”

(Tr. M., 29" May 2008, 192-193, 24-25, 1-8).

On these facts, Bayindir has not met its burden of proving bad faith. This is the more
so as the standard of proof is a demanding one for this purpose.

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal adds that a breach of FET requires conduct
in the exercise of sovereign powers. This requirement is not met in the present
situation in which the attempt to call on the guarantees appears as the act of an
ordinary contract partner which was carried out on foreign territory, i.e. in Turkey, in
accordance with Turkish legal procedures.

Finally, the arguments about the impact of the attempted encashment on the viability of
the Bayindir Group and Pakistan's unjust enrichment do not change the earlier
conclusions. First, the monies have not been cashed and thus the proposition of an
enrichment is difficult to follow. Second, any adverse consequences of the attempted
encashment on Bayindir's standing and viability, however unfortunate, are part of the
business risk that any contractor assumes when entering into a contract for a major
project with substantial financial exposure. This would only be different if the host state
had breached a treaty protection, which is not the case here.

In view of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the applicable FET
standard has not been breached.

Respondent's acts taken together

It remains for the Tribunal to review whether the Respondent's acts taken together
constitute a breach of the FET standard. It is true that Bayindir does not specifically

111

381.

382.

383.

claim that a breach of treaty could arise from the overall effect of all of Pakistan’s
actions. Yet, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to examine this issue as well.

On the basis of the evidence discussed in the preceding sections, the Tribunal has
denied the existence of treaty breaches with respect to each of the Respondent's acts
taken separately. Assuming for the sake of this analysis that a cumulation of non-
breaches can in theory result in a breach, this is certainly not the position here. Even
added up, the conduct of the Respondent does not amount to a Treaty breach. It might
give rise to contract liability, but that is a different issue on which this Tribunal makes
no assessment.

NATIONAL TREATMENT AND MFN STANDARDS

Bayindir claims a violation of the national treatment and most favoured nation (MFN)
standards embodied in Article II(2) of the Treaty. It incriminates specific acts. The
Tribunal will thus organize its discussion by reference to each of those acts first with
respect to national treatment (b) and then to MFN (c). Before doing so, it will identify
the applicable standards (a). At the end, it will consider whether all the acts of the
Respondent taken together could amount to Treaty breaches (d).

Applicable standards
Bayindir's position

The Claimant invokes Article II(2) of the Treaty as the basis for its claim. It refers to SD

® Occidental v. Ecuador’? and Lauder v. Czech

Myers,” Feldman v. Mexico,®
Republic’” to support the argument that the test of discrimination is an objective one,
which focuses on a measure's practical effect rather than on the Respondent's intent to
discriminate. It also relies on these authorities to assert that there is no requirement
that the differential treatment be motivated by foreign nationality and that the sole facts

of discrimination and foreign nationality are sufficient (Mem. M., (206).

385.

386.

388.

As to the facts relevant to a finding of discrimination, the Claimant recalls the Tribunal's
Decision on Jurisdiction:

"The fact remains that, taken together, Bayindir's allegations in respect of
the selective tender, and that the expulsion was due to Pakistan's decision to
favour a local contractor, and that the local contractor was awarded longer
completion time-limits, if proven, are clearly capable of founding a MFN
claim."

Pakistan's position

Pakistan submits that Bayindir's claim under Article |I(2) requires a showing of intent,
since Bayindir alleges that its expulsion from the Project was designed to benefit a pre-
determined group of local contractors, which "design" necessarily comprises intent. In
Pakistan's view, Bayindir's reliance on the decision in SD Myers is therefore irrelevant,
as that case "merely suggests that protectionist intent on its own (i.e. without a practical
effect) is insufficient for a finding of breach of Article 1102 NAFTA" (C.-Mem. M.. {
4.58).

Tribunal's determination

It is common ground that Bayindir's claim must be assessed under Article II(2) of the
Treaty, which reads as follows:

"Each Party shall accord to these investments, once established, treatment no
less favourable than that accorded in similar situations to investments of its
investors or to investments of investors of any third country, whichever is the
most favourable."

Article II(2) thus covers both national treatment and MFN obligations. Its purpose is to
provide a level playing field between foreign and local investors as well as between
foreign investors from different countries."

As noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers that the scope of the
national treatment and MFN clauses in Article II(2) is not limited to regulatory
treatment.’ It may also apply to the manner in which a State concludes an
investment contract and/or exercises its rights thereunder. Indeed, the Tribunal
stressed that:

Decision on Jurisdiction, § 223.

Noah Rubins & N. Stephan Kinsella, International Investment, Political Risk and Dispute
Resolution — A Practitioner's Guide (2005), pp. 225-226.

See Decision on Jurisdiction, J§ 205-206, 213.

113

389.

390.

"[tlhe mere fact that Bayindir had always been subject to exactly the same
legal and regulatory framework as everybody else in Pakistan does not
necessarily mean that it was actually treated in the same way as local (or third
countries) investors.""*

To decide whether Pakistan has breached Article II(2), the Tribunal must first assess
whether Bayindir was in a "similar situation" to that of other investors. The inquiry into
the similar situation is fact specific.'°© In line with Occidental v. Ecuador,'®
Methanex,'” and Thunderbird," the Tribunal considers that the national treatment
clause in Article II(2) must be interpreted in an autonomous manner independently from
trade law considerations.

If the requirement of a similar situation is met, the Tribunal must further inquire whether
Bayindir was granted less favourable treatment than other investors. This raises the
question whether the test is subjective or objective, i.e. whether an intent to
discriminate is required or whether a showing of discrimination of an investor who
happens to be a foreigner is sufficient. The Tribunal considers that the second solution
is the correct one. This arises from the wording of Article II(2) quoted above. It is also
in line with the rationale of the protection as was emphasized in Feldman v. Mexico,"°°
to which the Claimant referred:

"It is clear that the concept of national treatment as embodied in NAFTA and
similar agreements is designed to prevent discrimination on the basis of
nationality, or “by reason of nationality.” [...] However, it is not self-evident
[...] that any departure from national treatment must be explicitly shown to be
a result of the investor's nationality. There is no such language in Article
1102. Rather, Article 1102 by its terms suggests that it is sufficient to show
less favorable treatment for the foreign investor than for domestic investors in
like circumstances.

foreign-owned and domestic companies, and (2) do not otherwise unduly undermine the
investment liberalizing objectives of NAFTA” (78).

[R]equiring a foreign investor to prove that discrimination is based on his
nationality could be an insurmountable burden to the Claimant, as that
information may only be available to the government. [...]. If Article 1102
violations are limited to those where there is explicit (presumably de jure)
discrimination against foreigners, e.g., through a law that treats foreign
investors and domestic investors differently, it would greatly limit the
effectiveness of the national treatment concept in protecting foreign investors."

National treatment

It is Bayindir's contention that it was expelled for reasons of cost and local favouritism,
as evidenced by the selective tender that followed its expulsion. The Claimant also
asserts that PMC-JV, the local contractors retained, were treated more favourably, in
particular with respect to the construction schedule.

In paragraphs 297-300 supra, the Tribunal has already discussed Bayindir's allegation
that the expulsion was due to Pakistan's intent to favour local contractors. In the
present section, the Tribunal will review whether Bayindir was indeed accorded
treatment less favourable than the local contractors in breach of the national treatment
standard.

Bayindir's position

In Bayindir's submission, "the PMC-JV Contract forms a near perfect comparator
against which to judge Pakistan's treatment of Bayindir" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 125, 15-
17). Bayindir further asserts that it is objectively established that the Respondent
accorded more favourable time schedules to PMC-JV and reacted more leniently to
PMC-JV's unsatisfactory performance. Specifically, Bayindir alleges that

"PMC-JV was granted much more time to do the remaining work on the M-1
than Bayindir had been granted for the entire motorway, and when PMC-JV
fell far behind even in this generous schedule, PMC-JV was allowed to
continue on the Project. This is in stark contrast to the treatment Bayindir
received, and in stark contradiction to Pakistan's claims that Bayindir had to
be expelled out of concern for the timely completely [sic] of the M-1 Project."
(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 125-126)

In support of its allegation of less favourable treatment, the Claimant refers to the
following facts: PMC-JV was granted 1460 days to complete the remainder of the M-1
Project, whereas Bayindir had been granted only 730 days in 1993 and 1095 days in
1997 to complete the entire motorway; in March 2001, Bayindir had been granted only

115

395.

396.

397.

27 additional days to complete the two Priority Sections, whereas PMC-JV was granted
18 months to complete the remaining portion of the two Priority Sections, now for six
lanes; PMC-JV was permitted seven reviews of its work schedule, yet failed to achieve
the construction targets it proposed, whereas, as of the date of its expulsion from the
Project, Bayindir had completed 90% of the work on the two Priority Sections on the
areas which were free from obstructions; PMC-JV was not expelled for far more
significant delays than Bayindir ever experienced, even though PMC-JV's performance
was worryingly behind schedule, its progress very slow, and several sub-clause 46.1
notices had been issued. Bayindir adds that differences in performance between itself
and PMC-JV must be appraised taking into account that Bayindir had to prepare the
site, while PMC-JV started work on a site already prepared and developed by Bayindir.

In its post-hearing brief, Bayindir further referred to a series of acts such as the alleged
expropriation of Bayindir's contractual rights and the attempted encashment of the
Mobilisation Advance Guarantees (see paragraphs 349 and 360-364 supra) as
discriminatory and in breach of the Treaty. However, Bayindir did not specify the
manner in which these series of acts breached the national treatment/MFN clauses.

Pakistan's position

Pakistan maintains that the expulsion was lawful and later developments therefore
irrelevant. It also denies that Bayindir's residual investment was in a "similar situation"
to the investment of the local contractors (C.-Mem. M., {.4.51). It adds that there is no
room for a discrimination claim such as the one raised by Bayindir in a purely
contractual context_(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 293-294).

To demonstrate that the investments were not in "similar situations," Pakistan points to
differences in the financial terms;'"° the level of experience and expertise;'"' the scope
of work;'"? and in the commitment of the two entities to progressing with the works after

In particular, Pakistan notes that PMC-JV received no mobilisation advance and did not benefit,
as Bayindir, from having a foreign exchange component of its payments being settled by NHA in
rupees at highly favourable exchange rates.

Unlike Bayindir, PMC-JV was a consortium of diverse local Pakistani contractors with no
equivalent experience on projects of the magnitude of M-1.

In July 2003, shortly after the contract with PMC-JV had been signed, the scope of works was
converted back to a six-lane motorway, and works also involved repair and rectification of works
performed by Bayindir.

being issued sub-clause 46.1 notices.’

Pakistan further notes that the position of
NHA had changed as a result of Bayindir's expulsion, because NHA could neither avail
itself of the large Mobilisation Advance given to Bayindir nor collect on the guarantees,
and had to pay over Rs. 1 billion in order to alleviate the problem of Bayindir's sub-
contractors. Under such different circumstances, Pakistan argues that NHA was fully
justified in establishing new completion dates and, more generally, that it was justified

in treating the two situations differently (PHB [Pak.] {{ 5.53-5.99).

Pakistan finally insists that it was normal practice that the works be completed by a
group of Bayindir's sub-contractors:

"[t]heir bid was lower, they were already on site, and it is what Bayindir
wanted. These kinds of facts differentiate the present case from past cases of
discrimination. It was also in Bayindir's interest under Clause 63.3 of the
Contract that the cheapest option for a new contractor be chosen."

(PHB [Pak.] 15.2).
Tribunal's determination

The Tribunal will first determine whether Bayindir's investment was in a "similar
situation." If so, it will then assess whether Bayindir's investment was accorded less
favourable treatment than PMC-JV and whether the difference in treatment was
justified.

In respect of the first requirement, the Tribunal must start by determining whether there
is a relevant comparator to be used for the assessment of NHA's treatment of Bayindir
and PMC-JV. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal did not rule out that the
contracts with PMC-JV and Bayindir may be similar, as they both related to the same
project.'* The Tribunal must now go further and look at the terms and circumstances
of the contractual relationships between, on the one hand, NHA and Bayindir, and, on
the other hand, NHA and PMC-JV.

The Respondent has argued that, after its expulsion, Bayindir retained only residual
rights under sub-clause 63.3 of the Contract and, therefore, Bayindir's contractual
situation was not comparable to that of the local contractors who took over the Project.

In particular, Pakistan notes that, unlike Bayindir, PMC-JV had no prior history of shutting down
the works when it was faced with sub-clause 46.1 notices.

404.

The Tribunal is unpersuaded by this argument, which seems to assume that two
situations can only be "similar" if they are contemporaneous.

Turning to the terms and circumstances of the two contractual relationships, Pakistan
raises a number of differences especially in the financial terms; the constitution of the
two entities; their level of experience and expertise; the scope of work; and the
commitment of the two entities to progressing with the works after receiving a sub-
clause 46.1 notice. In contrast, Bayindir focuses on the identity of business sector and
project. The Claimant is right that the project and business sectors are the same. This
may be relevant in a trade law context. Under a free-standing test, however, such as
the one applied here, that degree of identity does not suffice to displace the differences
between the two contractual relationships.

The Claimant does not seriously dispute the existence of divergences in the financial
terms. The contract between NHA and PMC-JV did not involve a foreign currency
component. This difference must not be underestimated. The history of the dispute
between the Parties over the availability of foreign currency for the continuation of the
Contract illustrates this point. Indeed, as the Claimant emphasizes in its opening
statement at the hearing (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 16-29), the foreign currency issue was
one of the main reasons why by the end of 1999 "Bayindir had nearly stopped work in
the Project" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 27, 6-7). The dispute was then resolved by the
conclusion of Addendum No. 9 in which Bayindir accepted payment in rupees for half
of the Contract price. It is disputed whether Addendum No. 9 was more favourable to
the Claimant or for the Respondent. What is clear is the role played by the foreign
currency component.

Not surprisingly, the lack of a foreign currency component in the new contract price
discouraged foreign contractors from participating in the tender, a fact acknowledged
by the Claimant (Reply M., ¢ 219). Furthermore, the minutes of an NHA meeting held
on 13 November 2002, regarding inter alia the award of the balance works of the M-1
Project (Exh. [Bay.] CX-99) confirm the importance of the foreign currency issue. In
paragraph 24.1 of this document it is stated indeed that: "keeping in view the past
unpleasant experience in M-1 project as also some other projects, it was made

118

405.

407.

absolutely clear to all the prospective bidders at the pre-qualification stage that no
payment in foreign currency would be allowed" (Exh. [Bay.] CX-99).

Another difference in financial terms relates to the mobilization advance. The Claimant
does not seriously contest that, unlike Bayindir, PMC-JV did not benefit from a large
mobilisation advance. Under the terms of the Contract, Bayindir was to benefit from a
Mobilisation Advance of 30% of the value of the Contract price, which was to be paid
half in rupees and half in dollars. By contrast, the mobilisation advance contemplated
in Part Il of the conditions of contract between NHA and PMC-JV was far lower and
paid exclusively in rupees (Exh. [Bay.] CX-240A).

One might think of explaining the differences in advance payments by reference to the
equipment which Bayindir left on site. That explanation would be ill founded. The
evidence shows that such equipment was not fit for use (Exh. [Pak.] CM-170).
Mr. Nasir Khan, confirmed this point:

"Even though NHA had done an excellent job in preserving the equipment,
machinery and plant left behind by Bayindir (including the dump trucks, motor
graders, asphalt plants and crushing plants), the fact is that a large quantity of
the equipment, machinery and plant was old, in bad condition and in some
cases just not functioning."

(Nasir Khan's WS, 4 36)

Asked on cross-examination about a presentation made by Colonel Azim in November
2002 to the NHA Executive Board (Exh. [Bay.] CX-224) stating that "the 300 pieces of
Plant and Equipment have been parked in two camps and kept in perfect working
conditions through regular maintenance by NHA's field staff," Mr. Nasir Khan confirmed
his earlier testimony that the maintenance was good, but the plant was bad. He added

that with the plant that was handed over PMC-JV "would not have been able to

complete the project until today."""°

Quoting the passage in full: "the maintenance and, | mean, the owning of the machine
was in a very professional way, but it cannot change the status of the plant. Like, if - |
mean, just | will give you an example, there was two small plant installed, one was
installed at end of NWFP province, a camp which is called Barabanda — there were two
camps. One was Burhan and one was Barabunda. One was in Punjab and one was in
NWFP. The Punjab plant was definitely — they brought it second-hand. Used. Very used
plant. [ ... ] That plant, when we took over, we never were able to get it - capacity even
10%, so then we installed another small part in replacement of that plant because that
plant was not able to produce the production, the same was with the crushing plant, and
the same was with batching plants, because when we assess the condition, and the
capacity of plant and equipment, which was there, that according to that plant and

1.

Likewise, the record confirms the existence and relevance of other differences in
particular regarding the scope of work and the contractors’ expertise and experience.

The scope of works was different to the extent the Contract as amended by Addendum
No. 9 provided for four lanes and the contract with PMC-JV six. Mr. Nasir Khan
explained the change in the following terms:

"this Contract was four-lane motorway and it was converted into six-lane after
the award. Now, what happened was that there was some job done by
Bayindir, and then we immediately start our job and we have done some job.
Once it was converted to six lane, so we have to redo a lot of work. Now, that
redoing a lot of work, it is not taken into consideration that that was a major
factor of affecting our physical progress [ ... ] So, we took considerable time
and definetely method of doing this, because usually we don't do this on
ongoing Project.”

(Tr. M., 30 May 2009, 93-94)

The expertise and experience of the contractors constitutes another difference.
Bayindir benefited from considerable experience in handling large projects, while PMC-
JV did not. This difference which was reflected in the higher rates charged by Bayindir,
played a role in the expectations that NHA formed with respect to each contractor. So
testified General Javed:

"The expectation that | had [from Bayindir], when | understood the Project was, that
there would be a reasonable number of such high-tech equipment and machinery,
because remember, we were paying them the state-of-the-art rates, and one
expected to see a good quality of equipment."

(Tr. M., 29 May 2008, 14-15, 25, 1-5)

As a result, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the two contractual relationships
are too different for Bayindir and the local contractors to be deemed in “similar
situations.” Consequently, the first requirement for a breach of the national treatment
clause embodied in Article II(2) of the Treaty is not met. It thus makes no sense to
pursue the analysis of the other requirements.

MFN

Bayindir’s position

 

equipment with you was handed over to us by NHA, we would not have been able to
complete the Project until today, and maybe, maybe a year more, so then we supplement
with new plant and equipment, with additional plant and equipment, and the plant and
equipment was not able to produce efficiently, with just abandoned that plant, and it is still
abandoned today."(Tr. M., 30 May 2008, 63-64).

415.

In support of its claim under this heading, Bayindir refers to a press report of
17 September 2004 (Exh. [Bay.] CX-119) in which Pakistan's Minister of
Communications stated that out of 35, only six projects of NHA had been completed in
time during the years 1999 to 2003, the remaining 29 projects having been delayed for
several years. In spite of these delays and of the use of the FIDIC form of contract for
allegedly all of these other projects, only two other clause 63 notices were issued, and
no contractor other than Bayindir was expelled (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 97-98). In its
Memorial on the merits, Bayindir referred more specifically to the M-2, Islamabad-
Murree Dual Carriageway, and to the M-3 projects to contend that the treatment of
Bayindir, when compared to the contractors in these other projects, was unfavourable

and thus discriminatory.
Pakistan's position

Pakistan understands the Decision on Jurisdiction as denying jurisdiction over this
head of claim. For the event this understanding would prove incorrect, Pakistan
contends that Bayindir has not established that, as noted by the Tribunal in the
Decision on Jurisdiction, an objectively different situation is the result of unequal
treatment rather than of the existence of reasons to treat the two situations differently
(R. Rej., § 4.3). The Respondent argues that Bayindir has failed to provide the
information relevant to the contracts with which it seeks to compare its situation,
including information on the contract terms, performance, and reasons for the delays

(C.-Mem. M., (94.63, 4.66).

The Respondent also objects that NHA was under no obligation to grant identical
contract terms to different investors, because "[t]he protections of investment treaties
do not extend to insuring investors against the potentially adverse effects, or the less
than optimal nature, of the terms that they agree to in their investment contracts" (C.-
Mem. M., (4.67).

Tribunal's determination

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that Pakistan misinterprets the Decision on
Jurisdiction. That decision merely noted that Pakistan's objection pursuant to which
"[o]ther projects must be examined on their merits and in the light of the factual and
contractual context" (Reply J.. {| 4.96) could prima facie apply to Bayindir's contention

121

416.

417.

418.

419.

that it was the only contractor expelled in 29 out of 35 projects which suffered delays as
a result of problems similar to those faced by M-1.''® Bayindir's contention was not
discarded and remained to be substantiated in the merits phase.

The Tribunal must thus review whether the Claimant has substantiated its allegation of
breach of the MFN clause. For this purpose, it must start assessing the similarity of the
situations to be compared. As with national treatment, such similarity must be
examined at the level of the contractual terms and circumstances.

The Tribunal is in no position to proceed to any meaningful comparison between the
different situations at issue. To do so it would have needed sufficiently specific data on
the terms and the performance of the different contracts involved. It is true that
Bayindir, which carries the burden of proof, requested the production of several
categories of documents in connection with its allegation of less favourable treatment
than other foreign investors. In Procedural Order No. 4 of 27 November 2006, the
Tribunal granted some requests and denied others as insufficiently substantiated.

That said, the evidence on record is clearly insufficient to support this claim. This is so
even if one were to assume that the press report of 17 September 2004 is entirely
accurate. In effect, that report referred to 29 out of 35 projects of NHA not being
completed on time during the five preceding years (Exh. [Bay.] CX-119). Beyond this
statement, it also mentions that "delay occurred due to multifarious reasons including
revision in scope of work, change in design parameters, delay in release of funds, land
acquisition and removal and relocation of utilities" and "action [was being] taken
against the contractors in case the delay occur due to shortcomings on their part."
Hence, this report is of no assistance to Bayindir. Moreover, the unproven allegation
that all contracts are FIDIC-based is not very helpful either. Supposing it were right, it
would still not provide any data on terms that are essential to a meaningful comparison,
such as payment, funding, or completion periods.

The Tribunal is aware that it was not easy for the Claimant to discharge its burden of
proof on this claim. A shift of such burden, if at all permissible, would, however, have

a.

required a higher degree of substantiation on the part of the Claimant, at least by
reference to one potential comparator.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds that one of the necessary requirements of a breach of
Article !I(2), the similarity of the situations, is not met, which rules out a breach of the
MEN standard.

The Respondent's acts taken together

Bayindir further claims that the acts attributable to the Respondent taken together
constitute a breach of the national treatment and MFN standards.

Regardless of whether the cumulation of non-breaches may result in a breach, such a
conclusion would in any event be precluded here by the lack of similar situations in the
context of both the national treatment and MFN claims. Lacking similarity, even taken
together, the acts at issue cannot found a breach of these standards.

For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal holds that the Respondent has not breached
the national treatment and MFN clauses contained in Article II(2) of the Treaty.

EXPROPRIATION

Bayindir has claimed that Pakistan breached Article III(1) of the Treaty by expropriating
its contractual rights, its plant and equipment, and the Mobilisation Advance
Guarantees (Mem. on Merits, 222).

After determining the applicable standard for a finding of expropriation (a), the Tribunal
will discuss in sequence the alleged expropriation of Bayindir's contractual rights (b),
plant and equipment (c), and Mobilisation Advance Guarantees (d). The Tribunal will
further discuss whether all the acts referred to by Bayindir taken together may amount
to an expropriation (e).

Applicable standard

Bayindir’s position

123

426.

427.

428.

Bayindir contends that Article IIl(1) of the Treaty adopts a broad definition of
expropriation including any interference with an investor's property that deprives such
investor of the use or value of that property, whether such interference is direct or
indirect, in the context of nationalization or otherwise, insofar as the measure has an
effect similar to expropriation or nationalization (Mem. M., 9§_215, 217).

 

In Bayindir's submission, the definition does not cover tangible property alone, such as
plant and equipment, but also contractual rights. In this regard, Bayindir refers to
Vivendi II,’"’ which stated that "[t]here can be no doubt that contractual rights are
capable of being expropriated" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 103, 7-13). On the basis of this
and other authorities, namely the Chorzéw Factory case,'"® as well as the Orinoco''®

 

and Shufelat'®° arbitrations, Bayindir further argues that an expropriation of contractual
rights may arise in contexts other than nationalization measures (Ir. M., 4 June 2008.
102-103).

 

I?! and Siemens v. Argentina,” Bayindir stresses that

With reference to Vivendi I
expropriation may occur when a government "terminates a Contract for wilful,

discriminatory, or policy reasons" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 103, 16-18) and that "where a

 

State's breach of contractual rights does not consist of 'simple commercial acts' a
finding of expropriation is warranted" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 104, 2-5). Based on the

 

decision of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in SeaCo,"* Bayindir argues that it suffices to
show that contract rights were breached and that such breach was the result of
government directives in order to prove an expropriation of contract rights (Mem. M., §
221).

The Claimant also asserts that an expropriation may take place "when the effect of the
action is deprivation of property regardless of the intent" (Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 105, 6-

 

9). It emphasizes, however, that intent matters in this case, among other reasons,
because "discriminatory action is a strong indication that the action is expropriatory"
(Tr. M., 4 June 2008, 105, 11-12). In support, it refers to Eureko v. Poland'** to claim
that a government's discriminatory termination of contractual rights may constitute

 

expropriation.

125
t,

With reference to the decision in Wena Hotels v. Egypi it also notes that "forcible

eviction of an investor is a strong indication of an expropriation" (Mem. M., 237).
Pakistan's position

In substance, Pakistan's argument is that there can be no expropriation of a party's
contractual rights when such party is treated in accordance with the contract (Tr. M., 26
May 2008, 306-307).

 

Pakistan further asserts that, even in the event of a breach of contract, such breach
would not be sufficient to establish an expropriation (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 307-308). It
refers to Azinian v. Mexico, according to which:

"Labelling is, however, no substitute for analysis. The words 'confiscatory',
‘destroy contractual rights as an asset’, or 'repudiation' may serve as a way to
describe breaches which are to be treated as extraordinary, and therefore as
acts of expropriation, but they certainly do not indicate on what basis the
critical distinction between expropriation and an ordinary breach of contract is
to be made. The egregiousness of any breach is in the eye of the beholder —
and that is not satisfactory for present purposes."'~°

Pakistan also points to certain reasons in Waste Management, which read as follows:

"The Tribunal concludes that it is one thing to expropriate a right under a
contract and another to fail to comply with the contract. Non-compliance by a
government with contractual obligations is not the same thing as, or equivalent
or tantamount to, an expropriation. In the present case the Claimant did not
lose its contractual rights, which it was free to pursue before the contractually

Robert Azinian and Others v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2), Award of
1 November 1999, § 90. The Respondent further refers to Prof. lan Brownlie's Principles of
Public International Law, who states that: "the general view is that a breach of contract (as
opposed to its confiscatory annulment) does not create State responsibility on the international
plane.” lan Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 6th edition, 2003, pp. 522-523.

chosen forum. The law of breach of contract is not secreted in the interstices
of Article 1110 of NAFTA. Rather it is necessary to show an effective
repudiation of the right, unredressed by any remedies available to the
Claimant, which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a
substantial extent.""7”

In this respect, the Respondent underlines that the cases which have dealt with a
taking of contract rights, such as Aminoil,"*® Texaco Calasiatic v. Libya,"*° BP v.
Libya,'°° LIAMCO v. Libya,’*' Aramco v. Saudi Arabia,’ and Sapphire,‘ all
concerned the "abrogation of the Contract by a State that was engaging in a policy of
nationalisation" (Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 308, 20-21) and cannot be transposed to the
present circumstances.

Similarly, Bayindir's reference to Wena’ and SeaCo"* is said to be inapposite as the
facts of such cases have nothing in common with those of the present one.

With respect to Wena, the Respondent considers that forcible eviction of an investor as
such is not a strong indication of expropriation, as "an investor may remain on a site
unlawfully, and it may be perfectly lawful to evict, using force as appropriate" (C.-Mem.
M., 4.4.76). Whether the use of force may be an indication of an expropriation depends
upon the circumstances.

As to the SeaCo case, the Respondent stresses that it concerned a situation of alleged
expropriation by a State of a lease agreement between two third parties having no
relation to the State. It opposes Bayindir's interpretation of this decision as contrary to

the Decision on Jurisdiction, in which the Tribunal stated with reference to Impregilo v.
Pakistan:'°

"[O]nly measures taken by Pakistan in the exercise of its sovereign power
(‘puissance publique’), and not decisions taken in the implementation or
performance of the Contracts, may be considered as measures having an
effect equivalent to expropriation.""®

If a showing of breach of contract resulting from governmental directives were sufficient
to constitute expropriation, then any "governmental act would by definition be one of
puissance publique" (C.-Mem. M. 4.77), a proposition that Pakistan considers
unfounded. More specifically, Pakistan argues that:

"[I]n circumstances where (i) a State entity enters into a contract, (ii) that
contract was negotiated between the investor, the State entity and given
governmental departments and (iii) those governmental departments remain
involved in monitoring the performance of the contract, indeed, their input is
actively sought by the investor, it would not in any event be an act of
puissance publique for the governmental departments to recommend or even
direct that the contract should be terminated because of the investor's breach.
Such a recommendation or decision would constitute nothing more than a
decision taken in the implementation or performance of the given contract.”

(C.-Mem. M., 44.77)

Finally, Pakistan contends that a finding of expropriation generally requires, in addition
to the loss of the investment, arbitrary conduct or an intentional deprivation on the part
of the State (C.-Mem. M., 4 4.79; Rej. M., 4 4.49).

Tribunal's determination

The basis for the assessment of Bayindir's expropriation claim is Article III(1) of the
Treaty, which reads as follows:

"Investments shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subject, directly or
indirectly, to measures of similar effects except for a public purpose, in a non-
discriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation, and in accordance with due process of law and the general
principles of treatment provided for in Article II of this Agreement.”

The Tribunal concurs with the Claimant when it asserts that Article III(1) adopts a broad
concept of expropriation, potentially applicable not only to tangible property but also to
contractual and other rights, even outside the context of a nationalization.

Impregilo v. Pakistan, supra footnote 26, § 281.
Decision on Jurisdiction, § 257.

127

442.

443.

444,

The first step in assessing the existence of an expropriation is to identify the assets
allegedly expropriated. In the present case, the assets identified by the Claimant,
namely its contractual rights, plant and equipment, and the Mobilisation Advance
Guarantees, are within the scope of Article III(1) of the Treaty, and may potentially be
subject to an interference amounting to expropriation.

Having identified the assets, the next step is to identify the allegedly expropriatory
conduct. As stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction, expropriation may arise out of a
simple interference by the host State in the investor's rights with the effect of depriving
the investor of its investment.'® A critical issue in this regard concerns the intensity or
the effect of such conduct with respect to the investor's property. The Tribunal concurs

with Tecmed, CMS,'*? and Telenor,’ that an expropriation might occur even if the title
to the property is not affected, depending on the level of deprivation of the owner'*':
"[I]t is understood that the measures adopted by a State, whether regulatory or

not, are an indirect de facto expropriation if they are irreversible and
permanent and if the assets or rights subject to such measure have been
affected in such a way that “...any form of exploitation thereof...” has
disappeared; i.e. the economic value of the use, enjoyment or disposition of

the assets or rights affected by the administrative action or decision have been
neutralized or destroyed. Under international law, the owner is also deprived

of property where the use or enjoyment of benefits related thereto is exacted

or interfered with to a similar extent, even where legal ownership over the
assets in question is not affected, and so long as the deprivation is not
temporary. The government's intention is less important than the effects of

the measures on the owner of the assets or on the benefits arising from such
assets affected by the measures; and the form of the deprivation measure is

less important than its actual effects. To determine whether such an
expropriation has taken place, the Arbitral Tribunal should not:

[ ... ] restrict itself to evaluating whether a formal dispossession or
expropriation took place, but should look beyond mere appearances and
establish the real situation behind the situation that was denounced.""“?

The third step in this inquiry consists in examining whether the alleged interference with
the property or the rights of the investor has been made in the State's exercise of its

sovereign powers. As noted for instance in /mpregilo v. Pakistan cited in lieu of others,
such as Siemens v. Argentina," or RFCC v. Morocco™:

"[O]nly measures taken by Pakistan in the exercise of its sovereign power
("puissance publique"), and not decisions taken in the implementation or
performance of the Contracts, may be considered as measures having an
effect equivalent to expropriation.”

In the present case, the Claimant has suggested that a breach of the Contract as a
result of governmental directives would suffice for a finding of expropriation. The
Tribunal disagrees. First, not every contract breach deprives an investor of the
substance of its investment. Second, even where it does and the breach stems from a
governmental directive, it would not necessarily follow that the contractual breach is the
result of a sovereign act, as a directive of the State may be given in the framework of
the contract.

The fourth step in assessing the existence of an expropriation in breach of the Treaty is
the analysis of the conditions specified in Article III(1), namely (i) the lack of a public
purpose, (ii) discrimination, (iii) the absence of payment of prompt, adequate and
effective compensation, and (iv) a breach of "due process of law and the general
principles of treatment provided for in Article II of this Agreement."

Contractual rights
Bayindir's position

Bayindir submits that Pakistan expropriated the investment indirectly in a clandestine
manner under the pretext of exercising contractual rights, in order to give effect to a
governmental change in policy towards Bayindir. In Bayindir's submission, Pakistan
acted in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner with the intention of permanently
depriving it of its contractual rights. More specifically, through its forcible expulsion
pursuant to the notice of 23 April 2001, it was deprived of the benefits it expected to
derive from the Contract as well as from payment for works executed until the
expulsion.

448.

450.

451.

Pakistan's argument that Bayindir keeps a residual right to a final settlement of
accounts as such does not prevent a finding of expropriation, as was recognized in
Wena Hotels v. Egypt, SPP v. Egypt and Middle East Cement v. Egypt (Reply M.. 1
320-325).

In any event, the Respondent's conduct after the expulsion leaves no doubt on its
intention not to give effect to the final settlement of accounts under the Contract and,
therefore, to permanently deprive Bayindir of its contractual rights. Indeed, according
to Bayindir, Pakistan's interpretation of sub-clause 63.3 of the Contract is untenable, as
it was well understood from the beginning that Bayindir's expulsion would result in
substantial savings and would in any event require Bayindir to wait seven to eight years
(until works are completed by the local contractors) for a settlement and probably, at
this time, a dispute might arise regarding the amounts of the settlement. Thus, sub-
clause 63.3 cannot be relied upon by Pakistan to justify the absence of a prompt and
adequate compensation, in accordance with the BIT (Reply M., {1 42-45).

Moreover, according to Bayindir, sub-clause 63.3 of the Contract does not apply to
amounts already certified by the Engineer on the date of expulsion, but only to works
that the Contractor was in the process of performing. Thus, there was no justification
for withholding payment under payment certificates Nos. 20 and 21 (Reply M. 48).
Furthermore, Bayindir argues that several acts attributable to the Respondent which
were accomplished after the expulsion (see paragraph 349 supra) show that there was
no intention on the part of the Respondent to give effect to sub-clause 63.3 of the
Contract.

Bayindir further submits that the decision to expel Bayindir was the result of
governmental directives given by General Musharraf himself and based inter alia on
national policy and compliance with World Bank recommendations. In addition,
Pakistan acted in the exercise of its sovereign powers when it complied with the
directives and served the notice of expulsion upon Bayindir, and used the Pakistani
Army to ensure that Bayindir left the site.

Pakistan's position

130

452.

454.

455.

457.

Pakistan submits that the expulsion of Bayindir pursuant to the Contract cannot be
considered expropriatory of Bayindir's contractual rights, as such rights are limited by
the Contract itself.

Moreover, even if there had been a breach of the Contract, such breach would not
amount to expropriation. In Pakistan's submission, a finding of expropriation would
require proof of an improper motive for the expulsion (C.-Mem. M., { 4.80). It would
also require a showing of deprivation, which is not the case given the rights which
Bayindir keeps under sub-clause 63.3 of the Contract.

Pakistan also disputes that the expulsion was an act of "puissance publique" rather
than one carried out in the performance of the Contract. More specifically, it asserts
that:

"[l]n circumstances where (i) a State entity enters into a contract, (ii) that
contract was negotiated between the investor, the State entity and given
governmental departments and (iii) those governmental departments remain
involved in monitoring the performance of the contract, indeed, their input is
actively sought by the investor, it would not in any event be an act of
puissance publique for the governmental departments to recommend or even
direct that the contract should be terminated because of the investor's breach.
Such a recommendation or decision would constitute nothing more than a
decision taken in the implementation or performance of the given contract.”

(C.-Mem. M., 74.77)

Pakistan also notes that Bayindir's complaints about the threat of force is neither
established nor an indicator on its own of an unlawful measure, as it may be perfectly
lawful to evict an investor who remains on site unlawfully.

Tribunal's determination

Following the steps of the analysis set forth above (see paragraphs 442 et seq. supra),
the Tribunal starts by observing that the assets allegedly subject to expropriation are
Bayindir's rights under the Contract, including those relating to the payment for works
completed. Such rights have an economic value and can potentially be expropriated.

As a second step, the Tribunal finds that the measures through which Pakistan

allegedly deprived Bayindir's contractual rights of their economic value are in essence
the notice of expulsion and the taking over of the site.

131

Third, the Tribunal must review whether Pakistan has interfered with Bayindir's
contractual rights to an extent amounting to a deprivation of the economic substance of
such rights. In this regard, the fact that Bayindir was expelled is obviously not enough.
As rightly pointed out by the Respondent, if the expulsion was lawful under the
Contract, then there would be no taking of or interference with Bayindir's rights.
Moreover, even if the expulsion was conducted in breach of the Contract, that would
not as such be enough for a finding of expropriation under the Treaty. Bayindir submits
that its expulsion was contrary to the terms of the Contract as well as in breach of the
Treaty. While not a contract judge, the Tribunal must review those facts related to
contract interpretation and performance and here particularly related to the exercise of
certain contractual remedies to the extent necessary to rule on the Treaty claim. In this
regard, the Tribunal has already discussed at length in paragraphs 240-256 and 351-
359 supra that there is a reasonable interpretation of the Contract according to which
the mechanisms leading to Bayindir's expulsion as well as those regarding measures
subsequent to the expulsion were used in conformity with the Contract. On the basis of
such considerations, the Tribunal concluded that there was no breach of the applicable
FET standard. For the same reasons, the Tribunal cannot accept that there is a breach
of the treaty provision on expropriation.

The critical element for a finding of expropriation is the economic effect of the measure
rather than the intent underlying it. This is so even though Bayindir's claim focuses on
the Respondent's improper intent. The Tribunal has in any event already found that the
record does not show an intent on the part of Pakistan to permanently deprive Bayindir
of its residual contractual rights (see paragraphs 351-359 supra).

Bayindir's contractual rights are defined by the terms of the Contract. To establish an
expropriation of its rights as a result of NHA's exercise of its own contractual rights,
Bayindir must start by proving that its contractual rights were not limited by NHA's
contractual rights or that NHA took an action that, although allegedly based on the
Contract's terms, was in fact clearly in breach of such terms. Absent such proof, there
can be no deprivation of the economic substance of Bayindir's rights, as the scope of
such rights is limited by NHA's own rights under the Contract. The foregoing analysis
of the Contract (see in particular paragraphs 240-258, 301-314, 331-335, 346-347,

132

461.

462.

c.

463.

464.

465.

351-359, and 367-376 supra) shows that Bayindir has not succeeded in adducing proof
of these facts.

In addition, even if the expulsion violated the Contract and deprived Bayindir of the
economic substance of its contract rights, a finding of expropriation would only be
founded if the acts at issue were sovereign acts. The evidence does not point in this
direction. To the contrary, it shows that Pakistan can reasonably justify the expulsion
by Bayindir’s poor performance (see paragraphs 301-315 supra) with the consequence
that the expulsion must be seen in the framework of the contractual relationship, not as
an exercise of sovereign power. This conclusion is not contradicted by the close
involvement of the Pakistani government in the M-1 Project. As noted in section
IV(A)(b) supra, governmental involvement is not necessarily equivalent to the exercise
of sovereign power when it is grounded on legitimate contractual considerations.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Pakistan has not expropriated
Bayindir's contractual rights in breach of Article III(1) of the Treaty.

Machinery, plant, equipment, material, spare parts and office inventory

Bayindir’s position

Bayindir claims that, following its expulsion from the site, Pakistan's armed forces
confiscated its machinery, plant, equipment, material, spare parts and office inventory.
It argues that such confiscation occurred despite the fact that it disputed the sub-clause
63.1 certificate and the notice of expulsion. It adds that no contractual provision
required Bayindir to raise a separate dispute in connection with the expropriation of its
assets under sub-clause 63.2 of the Contract.

More specifically, Bayindir considers that, since the certification under sub-clause
63.1(b)(ii) was invalid, all acts carried out on this basis were unlawful and were
equivalent to an expropriation of its assets.

In Bayindir's submission, the expropriation of its tangible property occurred without
prompt and adequate compensation, and in a discriminatory manner through an act of
puissance publique. Bayindir further contends that the record shows that Pakistan
does not intend to repay Bayindir for its confiscated property.

471.

Pakistan's position

In substance, Pakistan's position is that the actions of NHA were entirely justified under
the Contract. It refers to sub-clause 6.2 of the Overriding Conditions of Contract
attached to Addendum No. 6 and sub-clause 63.1 of the Contract to support its
allegation that Bayindir had agreed that all permanently imported equipment would
eventually become property of NHA and that "given that NHA had issued a valid notice
[under sub-clause 63.1] it was expressly entitled to use the Contractor's Equipment,
Plant, Temporary Works and materials" (C.-Mem. M., 4 4.83).

Pakistan further argues that Bayindir "never questioned the retention of its Equipment,
Plant, Temporary Works and materials on Site after it was expelled in May 2001" (C.-
Mem. M., 44.84) and participated in the measuring up and inventory process carried
out pursuant to sub-clause 63.2 of the Contract.

Finally, the Respondent contends that NHA's acts were not undertaken in the exercise

of sovereign powers.
Tribunal's determination

The Tribunal’s reasoning on this head of the expropriation claim is in line with the
considerations set forth in connection with the claim for the expropriation of the contract
rights. It is true that this claim deals with tangible as opposed to intangible property
and that the controversial measures consist in the seizure and confiscation as opposed
to the notice of expulsion and the taking over of the site. These differences have no
bearing, however, on the assessment of the existence of an expropriation.

With respect to the contractual matters relevant for the assessment of a breach of the
Treaty, the Tribunal set out in paragraphs 240-256 and 351-359 supra that there is a
reasonable interpretation of the Contract under which the mechanisms leading to
Bayindir's expulsion as well as those regarding subsequent measures were used in
conformity with the Contract.

Moreover, the Respondent has offered a reasonable contract basis for the seizure and
use of Bayindir's property left on the site, with reference to sub-clause 6.2 of the

134

472.

473.

474.

Overriding Conditions of Contract attached to Addendum No. 6 and sub-clause 63.1 of
the Contract. Indeed, sub-clause 6.2, as subsequently amended, provides that:
"The Contractor shall be allowed to import construction machinery,
equipments and related spare parts to be incorporated into and used for the
Work without all taxes and duties (custom duty, surcharge [ ... ] and others)
payable to customs department on the condition that all such equipments,
machinery and spares shall be transferred without cost to the Employer after
the completion of the Work on an as is where is basis."

(Exh. [Pak.] C-3)
This provision must be read together with sub-clause 63.1, as modified by the

Conditions of Contract — Part Il, which provides that:

"[T]hen the Employer may, after giving fourteen day's notice to the Contractor,
enter upon the Site and expel the Contractor therefrom without thereby voiding
the Contract, or releasing the Contractor from any of his obligations or
liabilities under the Contract, or affecting the rights and powers conferred on
the Employer or the Engineer by the Contract, and may himself complete the
Works or may employ any other contractor to complete the Works. The
Employer or such other contractor may use for such completion so much of
the Contractor's Equipment, Plant, Temporary Works and materials, which
have been deemed to be reserved exclusively for the execution of the Works,
under the provisions of the Contract, as he or they may think proper, and the
Employer may, at any time, sell any of the said Contractor's Equipment,
Temporary Works and unused Plant and materials and apply the proceeds of
sale in or towards the satisfaction of any sums due or which may become due
to him from the Contractor under the Contract."

(Exh. [Bay.] C-11)
Furthermore, the record evidences that the measurement and inventory process took
place in relatively good conditions (see paragraphs 331-336 supra). NHA took account
of the concerns then expressed by Bayindir, that the FWO may be biased (Exh. [Pak.
CM-141), resulting in the nomination of the independent organization in charge of
conducting the joint inventory (Exh. [Pak.] CM-142), which reportedly completed its
task on 13 May 2003 (Exh. [Pak.] R-68).

In any event, even if a taking of Bayindir's machinery, plant, equipment, material, spare
parts, and office inventory in breach of the Contract could be established, such action
would not amount to a deprivation of the economic substance of Bayindir's remaining

investment.

Finally, even if one were to reach a contrary conclusion, it would still be necessary to
demonstrate that the conduct under review was effected in the exercise of sovereign

135

475.

d.
1.

476.

477.

478.

479.

power. For the reasons explained above, the Tribunal does not regard this
requirement as met (see paragraph 461 supra).

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Pakistan has not expropriated
Bayindir's property left on the site in breach of Article III(1) of the Treaty.

Mobilisation Advance Guarantees

Bayindir’s position

Bayindir argues in substance that through a series of acts attributable to the
Respondent which are set forth above and relate to the call of the Mobilisation Advance
Guarantees (see paragraphs 360-364 supra), the Respondent expropriated the
amounts covered by these guarantees. In Bayindir's submission, the guarantees fall
within the definition of ‘investment’ of the Treaty, as the Tribunal noted in the Decision

on Jurisdiction (Reply M., { 331).

Moreover, the Claimant argues that its reputation and creditworthiness were destroyed
by the call on the guarantees, which caused the destruction of its value as a company
(Tr. M., 26 May 2008, 127-128).

Pakistan's position

Pakistan submits that this claim had not been raised at the time of the jurisdictional
phase, and that the Tribunal thus lacks jurisdiction over it. In connection with
jurisdiction, it argues that "Bayindir has never suggested that the mobilisation advance
guarantees themselves constitute an investment falling within Article I(2) of the Treaty,
and they would not correctly be characterized as such" (C.-Mem. M., 4.87).

On the merits, Pakistan objects that the acts under review were in conformity with the
Contract (see paragraphs 365-366 supra). It also counters that the Mobilisation
Advance Guarantees constitute contracts between the Turkish banks and NHA. Thus,
the Contract, on the one hand, and the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees, on the other,
are between different parties and are juridically distinct (C.-Mem. M., (4.85).

136

481.

482.

483.

Pakistan further contends that the guarantees remain in effect, albeit in abeyance and
that there has been no payment under the guarantees, with the result that no
expropriation can have occurred (C.-Mem. M., ¥_ 4.88).

Tribunal's determination

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that it does not consider that Bayindir's claim for
expropriation of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees is a new claim. In its Decision
on Jurisdiction, it held that it had jurisdiction over Bayindir's claims for breach of the
Treaty, including for the alleged expropriation of Bayindir's investment. Although
Bayindir did not then clearly articulate the claim for the expropriation of the Mobilisation
Advance Guarantees, the latter can be deemed to form part of the overall investment.
Therefore, the Tribunal is of the opinion that this claim is within its jurisdiction as it was
affirmed in the Decision on Jurisdiction.

The Tribunal has already discussed the acts alleged by the Claimant under this claim in
connection with FET (see paragraphs 367-379 supra) and concluded that they did not
amount to a breach of the FET standard. The reasons which prevailed on FET apply
mutatis mutandis to the present head of claim. In essence, the Tribunal found that
Pakistan's contractual explanation was reasonable enough to disprove Bayindir's
allegations in connection with the misuse of the terms of the Contract. Even if such
breach could be established, this would not suffice for a finding of expropriation. There
is no evidence that such actions were undertaken in bad faith or for sovereign reasons,
particularly taking into consideration that the attempts to encash the Mobilisation
Advance Guarantees were conducted in accordance with the legal procedures of
another State within that State's territory. Moreover, the monies have not been cashed.
As to the adverse consequences of the attempted encashment on Bayindir's standing
and viability, however unfortunate, they are part of the business risk that any contractor
assumes when entering into a contract for a major project with substantial financial

exposure. Investment treaties are not meant to protect against business risks.
On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that the attempted encashment of the

Mobilisation Advance Guarantees does not amount to an expropriation in breach of
Article III(1) of the Treaty.

137

e.

484.

485.

487.

488.

Respondent's acts taken together

The question that remains is whether, despite the findings that the Claimant has failed
to establish the existence of a breach of Article III(1) of the Treaty in the context of
each of the specific acts so far considered, the evidence with respect to all the acts
taken together may support the existence of a violation of the Treaty.

The Tribunal considers that the aggregation of the different components of Bayindir's
expropriation claim cannot reverse its earlier findings. This is because such reasons
for the Tribunal's conclusions in the preceding sections go well beyond the amounts of
the alleged deprivation and concern, inter alia, the very characterization of the acts
under review as neither constituting a deprivation nor sovereign acts.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not breached
Article III(1) of the Treaty.

PROVISIONAL MEASURES

The Tribunal deems it useful to recall that, pursuant to paragraph (ii) of the operative
part of PO#1, the Tribunal ordered among others that:

"Pakistan take whatever steps may be necessary to ensure that NHA
does not enforce any final judgment it may obtain from the Turkish courts
with regard to the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees. This
recommendation remains in effect until: (a) an arbitral award declining
jurisdiction is issued; or (b) an arbitral award is rendered on the merits; or
(c)-any other order of the Tribunal amending the recommendations is
issued; whichever comes first."

(PO#1, at No. 78)

 

On 14 April 2008, the Tribunal then issued PO#11, in which it ordered that:

"(i) Bayindir shall take whatever steps may be necessary and use its
best endeavours to procure the withdrawal by Is Bank of its application
dated 14 March 2007;

(ii) In accordance with the rationale of the Tribunal’s decision of 29
November 2004, Pakistan shall take whatever steps may be necessary
to ensure that NHA does not enforce any final judgment it may obtain
from the Turkish courts with regard to the encashment of interest on
the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees;

(iii) The foregoing directions remain in effect until (a) an arbitral award
is rendered on the merits; or (b)-they are amended or revoked by order
of the Tribunal; [... .]"

138

489.

(PO#11, at No. 41)

 

As provided in the operative parts of both PO#1 and PO#11, these measures were to
remain in effect until the issuance of an award on the merits. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Tribunal confirms that the measures recommended in PO#1 and PO#11 will
cease to be in effect as of the date of the notification of the present Award. The
Tribunal also notes, in connection with the subsequent dispute over the potential
impact of Is Bank's application dated 14 March 2007 on NHA's recovery of default
interest on part of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees, that it is for NHA to seek
redress before a competent forum and under the proper law of such guarantees.

Costs

In the exercise of its discretion in matters of allocation of costs, the Tribunal finds it fair
that the Parties bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares and that each Party
bears its own legal and other costs expended in connection with this arbitration. In
reaching this decision, the Tribunal has pondered all the circumstances of the case,
including in particular the withdrawal of the Contract claims, the outcome on jurisdiction
in favour of Bayindir and on the merits in favour of Pakistan, the results achieved by
each Party on provisional remedies, and the fact that Bayindir's treaty claims, even if
they did not succeed on the merits, presented genuine issues which could legitimately
be brought before an investment tribunal.

139

V. RELIEF

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal issues the following Award:

a. The Respondent has not breached the fair and equitable treatment
standard applicable through the operation of Article II(2) of the Treaty;

b. The Respondent has not breached the national treatment and most
favoured nation standards contained in Article |I(2) of the Treaty;

c. The Respondent has not expropriated the Claimant in breach of Article
{I1(1) of the Treaty;

d. The measures recommended in PO#1 and PO#11 shall no longer be in
effect as of the date of the notification of the present Award;

e. The Parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares;

f. Each Party shall bear its own legal and other costs;

BACKGROUND FACTS
The M1 Motorway Project

The National Highway Authority (“NHA”) is a public corporation established by the
Pakistani Act No XI (National Highway Authority Act) of 1991 to assume responsibility
for the planning, development, operation and maintenance of Pakistan’s national
highways and strategic roads. Although controlled by the Government of Pakistan, NHA
is a body corporate in Pakistan with the right to sue and to be sued in its own name
(Section 3(2) National Highway Authority Act 1991).

Among other projects, NHA has planned the construction of a six-lane motorway and
ancillary works known as the “Pakistan Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway” (the “M1

Project”).

In 1993, NHA and Bayindir entered into an agreement for the construction of the M1
Project (the “1993 Contract”) (Exh. [Pak.] C-1). The 1993 Contract was a two page

agreement incorporating, inter alia, Addenda No.1-9 (Exh. [Pak.] C-1), the Conditions of

Contract - Part | and II (Exh. [Pak.] C-4), General Specifications, Special Provisions and

Addenda to General Specifications, Drawings, Priced Bill of Quantities (BOQ), as well

as the Bid and Appendices “A to M”. In particular, it bears noting that:

(i) Part | incorporated the FIDIC General Conditions of Contract for Works of Civil
Engineering Construction (1987 edition).

(ii) Part Il, entitled “Conditions of Particular Applications’, incorporated the
amendments and supplements to Part | as negotiated by the Parties.

Disputes arose in connection with the 1993 Contract, which NHA and Bayindir resolved
in 1997. As part of their settlement, on 29 March 1997 the parties executed a
Memorandum of Agreement “with the objective of reviving The Contract Agreement
dated 18 March 1993” (Exh. [Pak.] C-5). Under Clause 8 of this Memorandum of
Agreement, the Parties agreed “to apply to the arbitration tribunal in the appropriate
manner to seek the decision of the tribunal on only the issue of the quantum of

expenses incurred by Bayindir as specified in Bayindir's claim for expenses only"’.

On 3 July 1997, the Parties entered into a new contract, the “Agreement for the Revival
of Contract Agreement for the Construction of Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway” (the
“1997 Contract”) (Exh. [Pak.] C-6). The 1997 Contract incorporated the 1993 Contract
“in its entirety” with some “overriding conditions” agreed by the parties in the
Memorandum of Agreement signed on 29 March 1997.

For the sake of simplicity, the Tribunal will simply use the term “Clause of the Contract”
to mean the relevant clause of the (FIDIC) General Conditions of Contract (Conditions
of Contract — Part | incorporated in the 1993 agreement), as possibly supplemented by
the Conditions of Particular Applications (Conditions of Contract — Part II incorporated in
the 1993 agreement), as revived and possibly amended by the 1997 Contract. The
Tribunal will refer to the (revived) contractual relationship between the parties as the
“Contract”.

The Contract is governed by the laws of Pakistan.

By an arbitral award of 30 June 1999, Bayindir was ordered to pay USD 12,909,935 to NHA but
was declared entitled to retain USD 10,721,595 of the advance payment made under the Contract
in 1993 (Exh. [Pak.] L-27).

20.

It was a term of the Contract that NHA would pay to Bayindir 30% of the Contract price
as an advance payment (the “Mobilisation Advance”). Thereafter, NHA paid to Bayindir
an amount of USD 159,080,845 as Mobilisation Advance (namely two separate
amounts of USD 96,645,563.50 and PKR 2,523,009,751.707).

It was a further term of the Contract that Bayindir would provide a bank guarantee
equivalent to the amount of the Mobilisation Advance. On 9 January 1998, a consortium
of Turkish banks (comprising Turkiye is Bankasi A.S., Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.,
Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S., Finansbank A.S., DenizbanktheA.S. and Kentbank A.S.,
which subrogated its rights to Bayindirbank A.S.) issued two guarantees on behalf of
Bayindir to secure the Mobilisation Advance in accordance with the Contract (the
“Mobilisation Advance Guarantees”). Consistent with the Contract, the Mobilisation
Advance Guarantees were payable to NHA “on his first demand without whatsoever
right of objection on [the Bank’s] part and without his first claim[ing] to the Contractor”.
The amounts of the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees were to decrease, as interim

payments were made for work in progress®.
The performance of the Contract was to be supervised by an Engineer.

The Contracts set forth a multi-tier mechanism for “Settlement of Disputes”, which may
be sketched as follows:

e Any “matter in dispute shall, in the first place, be referred in writing to the Engineer”
(67.1(1) of the Contract).

e Either of the parties dissatisfied with any decision of the Engineer” “may give notice
to the other party of his intention to commence arbitration” (67.1(3) of the Contract).

e The parties “shall attempt to settle such dispute amicably” and, unless the parties
otherwise agree, arbitration cannot be commenced on or after the fifty-sixth day
after the day on which notice of intention to commence arbitration was given.

e The dispute shall then be “finally settled under the rules and provisions of the
Arbitration Act 1940 as amended or any statutory modification or re-enactment
thereof for the time being in force”.

Aw,

The parties seem to agree on a relevant exchange rate of 40.41 PKR to 1 USD.

The final terms of the reimbursement were set in Addendum No. 09 (see infra No. 23; Exh.
[Bay.] CX-12 at 3).

The same applies “if the Engineer fails to give notice of his decision on or before the eighty-
fourth day after the day on which he received the reference”.

The origin of the present dispute

On 3 June 1998, the Engineer issued the order to proceed to the construction with

original completion dates foreseen on 31 July 2000.°

Between September 1999 and 20 April 2001, Bayindir submitted several claims
regarding payment and four claims for extension of time (EOT) invoking different
omissions on the part of Pakistan (in particular delays in the construction work resulting
from late hand over of the land by Pakistan and/or NHA°).

The first two EOT claims (EOT/01 and EOT/02) were settled by agreement among the
parties during a meeting held on 18 February 2000. This agreement’ led to the
execution of Addendum No. 9 of 17 April 2000 to the Contract, which set out, among
other things, that “the revised Contract Completion Date shall be 31°' December 2002”
and that “NHA will hand over the remaining land as expeditiously as possible but not
later than 4 months from the signing” of Addendum No. 9. The detailed schedule
attached to Addendum No. 9 provided that two priority sections had to be completed
before 23 March 2003 (the Priority Sections).

Asserting primarily that NHA failed “to give the Possession of Site as per Addendum
No. 9”, on 15 January 2001 Bayindir submitted its third EOT claim (EOT/03) for
completion of the two “Priority Sections” by October 2001 (Exh. [Bay.] B-15). On 3 April
2001 the Engineer’s representative granted Bayindir a limited extension of time of
twenty-seven and ten days respectively (Exh. [Bay.] B-17).

See 1997 Contract. This date was extended till 31 December 2002 though Addendum No. 9
dated 17 April 2000 (see infra No. 23-24).

During the same period, Bayindir also issued several claims for delay in the settlement of
Bayindir’s monthly progress payments (interim payment certificates).

Under the agreement reached during the meeting of 18 February 2000, it was decided, inter alia,
that "December 2002 as the new completion date for the Project with about one year advance
completion of two sections from Islamabad to Burhan and Indus to Mardan" (Exh. [Bay.] B13).
Among other new conditions that were not contemplated by the agreement of 18 February 2000,
Addendum No. 9 provided that Bayindir had to “complete the two Priority Sections mentioned
therein by 23 March 2001”. It is Bayindir’s contention that it accepted this new demand by NHA
“[a]s a result of the pressure, coercion and duress exercised by Pakistan” (RA p. 5 {| 13).

By letter of 6 April 2001 Bayindir disputed this extension of time (Exh. [Bay.] B-18) and
referred the matter to the Engineer for his decision under Clause 67.1 of the Contract

reiterating its entitlement to an extension under EOT/03.°

On 19 April 2001 NHA informed Bayindir that liquidated damages would be imposed
on Bayindir for late completion of the two Priority Sections with effect from 20 April
2001; that is, the end of the limited extension granted on 3 April 2001 (Exh. [Bay.] B-
20).

The same day, Bayindir wrote to NHA to refer the decision to impose liquidated
damages to the Engineer pursuant to Clause 67.1, in particular on the ground that
EOT/03 was “still pending with the Engineer for decision” (Exh. [Bay.] B-25).

On 20 April 2001, Bayindir wrote to NHA to inform that it had been unable to complete
the Priority Sections “due to reasons beyond [its] control” and requested that “the
procedure [that is the submission of EOT/03 to the Engineer for decision under Clause
67.1] be allowed to follow to determine [its] entitlement for Time extension” (Exh. [Bay.
B-21).

On 23 April 2001 — before the engineer issued its determination — NHA served a “Notice
of Termination of Contract” upon Bayindir requiring the latter to hand over possession of
the site within 14 days (Exhibit [Bay.] B-26). Thereafter, the Pakistani army surrounded

the site and Bayindir’s personnel were evacuated.

On 23 December 2002 NHA concluded a contract for the “Completion of Balance
Works of Islamabad — Peshawar Motorway (M-1) Project with “M/s Pakistan Motorway
Contractors Joint Venture (PMC JV)” providing for a completion term of 1460 days
(Exh. [Bay.] CX29).

Related litigation

From January to July 2001, Bayindir served several Notices of Intention to Commence
Arbitration pursuant to Clause 67.1 of the Contract. The matters were not settled but the
arbitration was not pursued.°
The Engineer rendered its decision on EOT/03 on 28 June 2001 granting an extension of time
until 19 and 1% April respectively.

10

32.

33.

34.

35.

On 30 April 2001, Bayindir filed a constitutional challenge against the notice of
termination served by NHA before the Lahore High Court (Exh. [Pak.] D-15). On 7 May
2001, the Lahore High Court dismissed Bayindir’s constitutional challenge on the
ground that the Contract contained an arbitration clause (Exh. [Pak.] D-16, in particular
pp. 17-18)".

Between 2001 and early 2003, NHA raised a series of claims against Bayindir and
served a notice of arbitration. On 31 March 2003, NHA sought Bayindir’s concurrence in
the appointment of a sole arbitrator. On 10 April 2003, Bayindir informed NHA that it
had already submitted the matter to ICSID jurisdiction and requested to await the
decision on Bayindir’s request for ICSID Arbitration (Exh. [Pak.] D-23).

On 5 January 2004, NHA applied for the appointment of an arbitrator in Pakistan under
section 20 of the Arbitration Act 1940. On 28 May 2004, the Court of Civil Judge in
Islamabad appointed Mr. Justice (Retd.) Afzal Lone as arbitrator. The court
subsequently upheld an objection of NHA (claiming that Mr. Lone was too closely linked
with the previous government of Pakistan; that is the government that decided the
revival of the contract in 1997) and appointed Mr. Justice (Retd.) Zahid. Following a
request by Pakistan, NHA moved for an extension of time limits in such a manner that
the arbitration would not proceed prior to this Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction (see
infra No. 45).

In the meantime, on 24 April 2001, NHA called for payment under the Mobilisation
Advance Guarantees of approximately USD 100,000,000. Bayindir then obtained an
order from the Turkish courts enjoining the Banks from paying. This injunction was lifted
on 12 September 2003. Execution proceedings against the Banks, to which Bayindir is
not a party, are currently stayed following this Tribunal’s Procedural Order N° 1 (PO#1)
that Pakistan take steps to ensure that NHA does not enforce any final judgment it may
obtain from the Turkish courts with regard to the Mobilisation Advance Guarantees (see
infra No. 46).

 

With specific regard to a claim introduced on 7 September 2001 concerning escalation payment,
Bayindir filed an application under Section 20 of the 1940 Arbitration Act for the appointment of
an arbitrator on 19 April 2001 (Exh. [Pak.] D-13). The application was dismissed as premature
(failing notice under Clause 67.4 of the Contract) on 24 March 2003 (Exh. [Pak.] D-17). An
appeal against this decision was dismissed as withdrawn (Exh. [Pak.] D-19).

An appeal against this decision was dismissed as withdrawn by the Supreme Court of Pakistan
on 16 November 2003.

The BIT

The present proceedings are based on the "Agreement Between the Republic of Turkey
and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and
Protection of Investments" of 16 March 1995 (the “BIT”), which entered into force on 3
September 1997.

Article VII of the BIT contains a dispute settlement provision with respect to investments
between one of the parties and an investor of the other party (see infra N° 80).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIAL PHASE

On 15 April 2002, Bayindir submitted a Request for Arbitration (the “Request” or “RA”)
to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the
“Centre”), accompanied by 15 exhibits (Exh. [Bay.] B-1 to B-15). In its Request Bayindir
invoked the provisions of the BIT and sought the following relief:

(i) payment of outstanding Interim Payment Certificates US$62,514,554.00;

(ii) | payment of additional financial claims related to the Works completed by
Bayindir provisionally quantified as US$27,000.000.00;

(iii) | reimbursement of all costs incurred in anticipation of completing the
Project by Bayindir US$19,071,449.00;

(iv) payment against all fixed and movable assets expropriated by Pakistan
US$43,050,619.00;

(v) | compensation for mobilisation and demobilisation costs US$7,444,854.00;

(vi) compensation for profits lost through Pakistan’s unlawful acts and
omissions provisionally quantified as US$107,154,634.00;

(vii) compensation for damage to Bayindir's reputation resulting from Pakistan's
unlawful acts and omissions provisionally quantified as
US$150,000,000.00;

(vii) [...] compensation and costs on account of the following items:

(i) the reimbursement of all costs incurred by Bayindir in pursuing the
resolution of the claims brought in this arbitration, including but not
limited to the fees and/or expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID, legal
counsel, experts and Bayindir's own experts and staff;

(ii) compounded interest on all amounts awarded at an appropriate rate
or rates and over an appropriate period or periods;

(iii) compensation for opportunities lost as a direct result of Pakistan's
unlawful acts and omissions;

(iv)

compensation for losses and damages suffered by Bayindir in Turkey
as a direct consequence of Pakistan's unlawful acts and omissions;

(v’

any other relief that the Arbitral Tribunal may deem fit and appropriate
in the circumstances of this case.

(RA, 1939-40)

On 16 April 2002, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the “Institution
Rules”), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the RA to Pakistan and to the
Pakistani Embassy in Washington D.C.

After a long and extensive exchange of correspondence between Bayindir'’,
Pakistan”, NHA"® and the Centre, on 1 December 2003, the Secretary-General of the
Centre registered Bayindir's RA, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the
“ICSID Convention” or “the Convention”). On the same date, the Secretary-General, in
accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the request
and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.

In the absence of agreement between the parties, on 6 February 2004, Bayindir elected
to submit the arbitration to a panel of three arbitrators, as provided in Article 37(2)(b) of
the ICSID Convention and appointed Prof. Karl-Heinz Béckstiegel, a national of

In particular, on 10 February 2003, Bayindir supplemented its RA by the submission of a Volume
HL

In particular, on 23 May 2002, the republic of Pakistan stated that “[t]he nomination of Secretary
Communication by [Bayindir] is without any relevance to the terms of Contract. In view of
provisions of Contract Agreement and various guarantees given by [Bayindir] to NHA for faithful
performance of [Bayindir]'s obligations and against Mobilization Advance; NHA is the party to the
Contract and not the Secretary Communication. The alleged dispute is manifestly outside the
jurisdiction of the Centre, pursuant to sub-para 1 Article 25, sub-para 3 of Article 36, sub-para
1(b) of Rule 6 of INSTITUTION RULE of the Centre. The contents of the requests by [Bayindir]
are in contravention to Rule 2 of the INSTITUTION RULE of the Centre” (Pakistan's submission
of 23 May 2002). The Government of Pakistan further “requested that all future communication
and notices if required, regarding the subject issue, are to be sent to the [NHA]” (Pakistan's
submission of 19 February 2003).

In particular, on 22 August 2003, NHA submitted its “Observation and Reply to ICSID” with
reference to Bayindir’s RA. In its submission NHA concluded that “[t]he documented statements.
as given in this submission provide further material to conclude the fact that Bayindir had never
been an Investor neither the dispute referred to ICSID has any bearing with the relevant
provision of BIT. Therefore, the ‘Request for Arbitration’ submitted by Bayindir to ICSID is void of
merits at its own account and manifestly beyond the jurisdiction of ICSID. Therefore, the
Secretary General is requested to refuse the registration of Bayindir's ‘Request for Arbitration’
pursuant to Article 36(3) and institution Rule 6(1)(b) of the Convention” (NHA’s submission of 22
August 2003, p. 2, emphasis in the original).

Germany. On 26 February 2004, Pakistan appointed Sir Franklin Berman, a national of
the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. On 27 April 2004, the parties agreed to appoint Prof.
Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as the President of the Tribunal.

On 15 June 2004, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), notified the
parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal
was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that
date. The same letter informed the parties that Mr. José-Antonio Rivas, Counsel, ICSID,
would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal'*.

On 20 July 2004, Bayindir submitted a Request for Provisional Measures, seeking in
substance recommendations by the Tribunal that the Respondent stay all proceedings
pending before the Courts of Pakistan and Turkey. On 27 August 2004, Pakistan filed
its Response to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures.

The Arbitral Tribunal held a first hearing on 24 September 2004, at the offices of the
World Bank in Paris. At the outset of the preliminary hearing, the parties expressed
agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted (Arbitration Rule 6) and
stated that they had no objections in this respect. The parties further agreed on a set of
procedural rules to apply to the present proceedings. The preliminary hearing was tape-
recorded, a verbatim transcript was taken and later distributed to the parties (Tr. P.).

During the course of the preliminary hearing, the parties’ counsel also presented oral
arguments on Bayindir’s request for provisional measures. At the end of the preliminary
hearing, Bayindir withdrew its request seeking a stay of the arbitration pending in
Pakistan between NHA and Bayindir before the sole arbitrator, Mr. Justice (Retd.)
Zahid, '® as a result of an offer by Pakistan to request NHA to move for an extension of
the time limits fixed in the latter in such a manner that the Pakistani arbitration would

In the course of the Proceedings, Mr. Rivas was replaced by Ms. Martina Polasek, Counsel,
ICSID, on 11 May 2005.

As amended at the hearing, this request reads as follows: “1. The Parties immediately take all
steps required to obtain a temporary stay of all proceedings brought under the Pakistan
Arbitration Act 1940 and pending before the Courts of Pakistan and/or before an arbitrator”
(Bayindir's_ amended Request _for provisional submitted at the hearing on 24
September 2004).

not proceed before this Tribunal rendered its decision on jurisdiction (Tr. P. 153:17-
155:25).

On 29 November 2004, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Claimant’s Request for
provisional measures (PO#1), which reads as follows:

Having reviewed the Claimant's and the Respondent's written submissions and
having heard oral argument, the Tribunal issues the following order:

(i) The Tribunal acknowledges that Bayindir withdrew the request seeking a
stay of the Pakistani arbitration as a result of an offer of Pakistan to
request NHA to move for an extension of time limits in such a manner that
that arbitration will not proceed prior to this Tribunal’s decision on
jurisdiction.

(ii) The Tribunal recommends that Pakistan take whatever steps may be
necessary to ensure that NHA does not enforce any final judgment it may
obtain from the Turkish courts with regard to the Mobilisation Advance
Guarantees. This recommendation remains in effect until: (a) an arbitral
award declining jurisdiction is issued; or (b) an arbitral award is rendered
on the merits; or (c)-any other order of the Tribunal amending the
recommendations is issued; whichever comes first.

(iii) The Tribunal dismisses Pakistan’s request to recommend, as a matter of

principle, that Bayindir should provide security for Pakistan’s costs.

The Tribunal will rule on the costs of this application in its decision on
jurisdiction or, if it asserts jurisdiction, in its decision on the merits of the
dispute.

(PO#1, at No. 78)

(iv

 

As a threshold matter in the Tribunal’s decision on provisional measures, the Tribunal
emphasized that the reasons contained in that decision were “without prejudice to a
later decision of this Tribunal on Pakistan’s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal”

(PO#1, at No. 40).

THE WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION

In accordance with the timetable agreed during the preliminary hearing, on 31
December 2004, Pakistan submitted its Memorial on jurisdictional objections (Mem. J.)
accompanied by one volume of contractual documents (Annexes C-1 to C-13), four
volumes of legal materials (Annexes L-1 to L-43) and one volume of Documentary
Exhibits (Exhibits 1 to 35). Pakistan did not append any witness statement or expert
opinion.

In accordance with the timetable agreed during the preliminary hearing, on 31 March
2005, Bayindir submitted its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction (C-Mem. J.) accompanied

15

50.

51.

52.

53.

54.

by one volume of documentary evidence (CX 79 to CX 124) and five volumes of legal
materials (Exhibits CLEX 18 to CLEX 55). Bayindir did not append any written witness
statement or expert opinion.

In accordance with the timetable agreed during the preliminary hearing, on 9 May 2005,
Pakistan submitted its Reply to Claimant's Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction (Reply J.)
accompanied by one volume of documentary exhibits (Exhibits R-1 to R-74) and one
volume of legal materials (Exhibits RL-1 to RL-22).

Within the extension of time allowed by the Tribunal, on 17 June 2005, Bayindir
submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (Rejoinder J.) accompanied by one volume of
documentary exhibits (Exhibits CX 125 to CX 156)"® and one volume of legal materials
(Exhibits CLEX 56 to CLEX 61).

On 5 July 2005, pursuant to Article 19 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal
invited Pakistan to file a written response limited to the new factual allegations
contained in JJ] 101 to 104 of Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on or before 15 July
2005.

On 7 July 2005, the Tribunal held a preparatory telephone conference to organize the
hearing on jurisdiction for which the dates of 25 and 27 July 2005 had previously been
retained. None of the parties having submitted witness statements or expert opinions, it
was agreed that the hearing on jurisdiction would be limited to oral arguments.

On 11 July 2005, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties that the
jurisdictional hearing would be held on 25, 26 and 27 July 2005 and transmitted the
agenda for the hearing.

At the outset of the hearing on jurisdiction, Pakistan pointed out that some of these exhibits —
namely Exh. [Bay]CX127, an internal letter dated 4 November 2000; Exh. [Bay]CX131, an
internal letter dated 2 May 2001; Exh.[BaylCX145, an internal letter of June 2001; Exh.
Bay]CX146, an internal letter dated May 200; Exh. [Bay]CX151, an internal letter of April 2001;
Exh. [Bay]CX152, a confidential letter from the World Bank dated 26 May 2000 to the
Government of Pakistan; Exh. [Bay]CX153, a confidential letter from the World Bank to the
Government of Pakistan dated 5 June 2000 — constituted “confidential and privileged legal
materials which have apparently been taken from the files of the Government of Pakistan” (Tr.
J., 18:3-16). Pakistan did not however object to their production in this arbitration (see infra No
248).

On 22 July 2005, Mr Bundy wrote to the Tribunal to inform it that Pakistan had ratified
the New York Convention and attached the ratification instrument dated 9 June,
deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 14 July. Mr. Bundy’s
letter also informed the Tribunal that Pakistan had enacted the New York Convention in
the form of the Recognition of Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements and Foreign
Arbitral Awards Ordinance of 2005, which came into force with retroactive effect on 14
July 20057”.

THE HEARING ON JURISDICTION

During the jurisdictional hearing, Messrs. Veeder, Greenwood, Wordsworth and Bundy
addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Pakistan and Mr. Griffith addressed the Tribunal on
behalf of Bayindir.

The jurisdictional hearing was tape-recorded, a verbatim transcript was taken and later
distributed to the parties (Tr. J.). It ended earlier than scheduled, both parties having
fully presented their arguments and agreeing to such change of schedule.

It was agreed at the close of the jurisdictional hearing that the Tribunal would issue a
reasoned decision on the preliminary questions of jurisdiction and admissibility. If the
decision were negative, the Tribunal would render an award terminating the arbitration;
if the decision were affirmative, the Tribunal would render a decision asserting
jurisdiction and issue an order with directions for the continuation of the procedure
pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4).

The Tribunal has deliberated and thoroughly considered the parties’ written
submissions on the question of jurisdiction and the oral arguments delivered in the
course of the jurisdictional hearing. Before reaching a conclusion on the question of
jurisdiction, the present decision summarizes (Ill) and discusses (IV) the position of the
parties.

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

BAYINDIR’S POSITION

In its written and oral submissions, Bayindir advanced the following four main
contentions:

18

62.

63.

64.

65.

(iv)

Bayindir made an “investment” under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention;
Bayindir has prima facie claims against Pakistan for breaches of the BIT, namely
for breaches of the treaty provisions on national and most favoured nation
treatment, fair and equitable treatment and expropriation without compensation
(hereinafter generally referred to as “Treaty Claims”);

The Treaty Claims are distinct and autonomous claims which Bayindir can assert
against NHA (and or Pakistan) independently from those claims which arise out of
the Contract (hereinafter generally referred to as Bayindir’s “Contract Claims’).
Finally, as an independent argument, Bayindir claims that the Tribunal also has
jurisdiction over the Contract Claims.

On the basis of these contentions, Bayindir requested the Tribunal to decide:

[t]hat this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims for breach of the BIT, but in
addition also claims that would be only contractual in nature. The requirements
for this Tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction under the BIT over the Parties and
over Bayindir's claim have been satisfied.

(C-Mem. J., p. 88, 1312)

At the outset of the jurisdictional hearing, Bayindir withdrew its independent argument

that the Tribunal has jurisdiction also over the Contract Claims:

[I]t appears to us that our claim for treaty breaches is so strongly expressed that
it is not necessary for us to turn to alternative and fall-back mechanisms to
pursue our claims by asserting as we did in Part VI of our counter memorial that
even if there is no treaty BIT breaches made out nonetheless we can make a
freestanding contract claims as the basis of our jurisdiction under ICSID and
under the BIT.

(Tr. J., 7:12-19)

Accordingly, Bayindir resiles from pressing purely contractual claims (Tr. J., 60:2-4).

 

PAKISTAN’S POSITION

In its written and oral submissions, Pakistan advanced the following six main

arguments:

Bayindir has not made an investment within article (2) of the BIT or Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention.

The basis of Bayindir’s claims is alleged breach of the Contract. The Contract is
governed by the law of Pakistan and, pursuant to the law of Pakistan, the
Employer (NHA) is a separate legal person, distinct from Pakistan. The Tribunal
has no jurisdiction in respect of alleged breaches of the Contract as such
breaches are not attributable to Pakistan.

19

66.

67.

68.

(iii) The Contract Claims are inadmissible in the light of the agreement of the
Employer and the Contractor to refer their disputes to arbitration, and the
proceedings should be stayed pending resolution of the contractual dispute by
arbitration.

(iv) To the extent that Bayindir’s claims are based on an alleged breach of the BIT,
ie., to the extent that they are Treaty Claims, they are entirely artificial and
advanced solely for purposes of expediency.

(v) Since Bayindir’s Treaty Claims are dependent upon the claims for breach of the
Contract that have to be settled in another forum, the Tribunal cannot exercise
jurisdiction over the Treaty Claims, at least until that other forum has reached a
conclusion with regard to the alleged breach of the Contract.

(vi) Insofar as Bayindir’s Treaty Claims are distinct from the alleged breach of the
Contract, these allegations “have no colourable basis” and are insufficient for this
Tribunal to assert jurisdiction.

In reliance on these arguments, Pakistan invites the Tribunal:

[tlo declare that it has no jurisdiction in respect of the whole of Bayindir's claim,
and that the claim is accordingly to be dismissed. Insofar as the Tribunal
considers that the claim is not to be dismissed in its entirety for want of
jurisdiction, Pakistan invites the Tribunal to make alternative declarations to
reflect restrictions on its jurisdiction and/or on the admissibility of Bayindir's
claims, namely:

a. That it has no jurisdiction in respect of Bayindir's allegations of breach of the
Contract, alternatively that such claims are inadmissible before this
Tribunal;

b. That, insofar as the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine Bayindir's claims
characterised as breaches of the BIT, such claims should not be heard
pending resolution of the disputes pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement in
the Contract.

(Mem. J., p. 2)

Following Bayindir’s above-mentioned change of position at the outset of the
jurisdictional hearing, on 16 August 2005 Pakistan requested the Tribunal to:

[d]eal with the issues of principle and apportionment relating to costs in its
award/decision, including the wasted costs due to Bayindir’s late change in
position, and to award the Government of Pakistan its costs and expenses
incurred as a result of these proceedings. °

On 26 August 2005, Bayindir submitted in response “that the issue of costs should be a

matter for submission after the award on objections to jurisdiction””°.

On 29 August 2005, “in the light of the above[-mentioned change in Bayindir’s position],
Pakistan request[ed] the Tribunal’s permission to withdraw its offer to request NHA to
move for an extension of the time limits in the Pakistani arbitration so that this does not

proceed prior to a decision on jurisdiction in the present case” (see supra N° 46).

On 20 September 2005, Bayindir opposed such request, asked that it “be declined and
taken up for consideration after the decision on jurisdiction and upon consulting the
parties on opportunity to make written and oral submissions.”

In support of their position on jurisdiction, both parties have relied on rules of
international law, decisions of courts and arbitral tribunals, and opinion of learned
authors. In the course of the following discussion, the Tribunal will review the law
pleaded by the parties and its applicability to the facts of the present case. The Tribunal
adds that while Part Ill of this decision summarizes the main arguments of the parties,
other arguments were made and considered by the Tribunal, and will be referred to in
Part IV to the extent the Tribunal considers them relevant.

DISCUSSION

INTRODUCTORY MATTERS

Before turning to the actual issues, the Tribunal wishes to address certain preliminary
matters, i.e., the relevance of previous ICSID decisions (a), some uncontroversial
matters (b), the law applicable to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the relevant issues for
determination (c).

The relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards

In support of their position, both parties relied extensively on previous ICSID decisions
or awards, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present
case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.

In particular, part of the parties’ oral and written submissions was devoted to discussing
the relevance, the scope and the ‘appropriateness’ of the recent decision on jurisdiction

21

in the arbitration between Impregilo S.p.A. and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan

(hereinafter the Impregilo case)*'.

For instance”, in its Rejoinder on jurisdiction, Bayindir submitted:

As a final point, Bayindir again submits that this Tribunal is not bound to follow
the decisions of other investment Tribunals deciding different cases on the basis
of similar, yet distinctly worded treaties. Nevertheless, this Tribunal will be asked
in the Rebuttal to carefully consider the very recent decision of /mpregilo v.
Pakistan. Contrary to the Reply, rather than assisting Pakistan, the /mpregilo
decision actually exposes several of the major flaws in Pakistan's arguments, as
shall be hereafter discussed.

(Rejoinder J., p. 3, 1.9)

The Tribunal agrees that it is not bound by earlier decisions”*, but will certainly carefully
consider such decisions whenever appropriate.

Uncontroversial matters

There is no dispute as to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to decide the jurisdictional
challenges brought by Pakistan (Article 41 of the ICSID Convention).

Pakistan’s jurisdictional objections are related to the nature of the dispute and to the
legal characterization of the claims. In other words, Pakistan contests the
jurisdiction of the tribunal ratione materiae. Pakistan raises no jurisdictional
objection ratione personae or temporis**.

decision.pdf (Exh. [Pak]RL-1 = Exh. [Bay]CLEX 57).

Pakistan expressed a similar view for instance as regards the most favoured nation clause of
Article II(2) of the BIT. After having relied upon Siemens v. Argentina [infra Fn. 80] to contend
that “[pJursuant to its ordinary meaning, the more favourable protection that Bayindir seeks falls
outside the scope of Article II(2) of the 1995 Treaty”, Pakistan felt compelled to add the
following: “The Tribunal is not, of course, bound by the decisions of previous ICSID tribunals on
the extent of most favoured nations provisions in other treaties. However, if necessary, Pakistan
will submit that, in the absence of express wording, it would be wrong to find that the rights of an
investor under a most favoured nation provision could extend to benefiting either from an
agreement to arbitrate where there was no such agreement” (Mem. J., p. 65, 91 5.9).

Inasmuch as they involve objective requirements, these conditions shall be analysed by the
Tribunal motu propio (see SCHREUER, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, Cambridge (UK),
2001, para. 4-45 ad Article 41, pp. 535-536). The Tribunal notes that the Parties to the dispute
are a State (Pakistan), and a Turkish company (Bayindir) and that both Pakistan and Turkey are
Contracting States within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

22

The law applicable to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the relevant issues

This Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae depends in the first instance upon the
requirements of the BIT and of the ICSID Convention.

Article VII of the BIT contains the following dispute settlement clause:

1. Disputes between one of the Parties and an investor of the other Party, in
connection with his investment, shall be notified in writing, including a
detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the investment.
As far as possible, the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavour to
settle the disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith.

2. If these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months following the
date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the dispute can be
submitted, as the investor may choose, to:

(a) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
set up by the ‘Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes
Between States and nationals of other States’; [in case both Parties
become signatories of this Convention]

(b) an ad hoc court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration Rules of
Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Law
(UNCITRAL), [in case both Parties are members of UN]

(c) the Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce,

provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the
courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award
has not been rendered within one year.

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out
of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or
agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in
writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no
party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

The Tribunal notes that Pakistan has not objected to its jurisdiction on the ground that
the dispute is not legal or that it does not involve a Contracting State and a national of
another Contracting State.

In order to establish the jurisdiction of this Tribunal under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention, Bayindir relies upon (1) the consent of Pakistan to arbitration as contained
in the BIT combined with (2) its own consent as contained in the Request for arbitration.
As the tribunal held in /mpregilo, according to a now “well established practice, it is
clear that the coincidence of these two forms of consent can constitute ‘consent in

23

84.

85.

86.

87.

writing’ within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention [...] if the dispute
falls within the scope of the BIT.”*° This is not disputed by Pakistan.

Pakistan has objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and/or to the admissibility of
Bayindir’s claim.

Pakistan’s objection to jurisdiction is based on the following grounds:

(i) Bayindir has not made an investment within Article I(2) of the BIT or Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention.

(ii) | There are no freestanding treaty breaches capable of being alleged by Bayindir.

(iii) | Insofar as there are alleged breaches of the Treaty distinct from the alleged
breaches of the Contract, these allegations “have no colourable basis”, i.e., they
are not “sustainable”.

Pakistan’s objection to the admissibility of the claim is based on the following grounds:

(i) To exercise jurisdiction would raise a potential conflict between two very
important treaties, the 1958 New York Convention and the 1965 Washington
Convention.

(ii) | Insofar as there are alleged breaches of the Treaty distinct from the alleged
breaches of the Contract, Bayindir is barred from raising them as it has
previously characterized these breaches as contractual.

(iii) | Insofar as there are alleged breaches of the Treaty distinct from the alleged
breaches of the Contract, the ICSID proceedings should be stayed pending the
resolution of the contractual dispute by arbitration.

(iv) Bayindir has failed to comply with the formal requirements of Article VII of the

The Tribunal will examine Pakistan’s objections in turn, without distinguishing between
objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and objections to the admissibility of the
claims”®. For the sake of logic, the Tribunal will begin with Pakistan’s objection that
Bayindir has failed to comply with the pre-conditions to arbitration in Articles VII(1) and
(2) and that, accordingly, Bayindir is not entitled to submit any dispute to arbitration
under Article VII(2) of the 1995 Treaty.

HAs BAYINDIR FAILED TO COMPLY WITH FORMAL REQUIREMENTS PREVENTING IT TO
SUBMIT THE PRESENT DISPUTE (ARTICLE VII OF THE BIT)?

Pakistan’s first, “fundamental and principled objection” is that Bayindir did not satisfy the
“prerequisites for jurisdiction” set forth in Article VII of the BIT (Tr. J., 73:17-26). More

 

specifically, Pakistan contends that Bayindir has failed to give notice of any claim for
alleged breaches of the BIT and/or to negotiate in respect of such a claim as provided
by Article VII of the BIT “and that, accordingly, Bayindir is not entitled to submit any
dispute to arbitration under Article VII(2) of the 1995 Treaty” (Mem. J., p. 67
115.10).

In its relevant part, Article VII of the BIT provides that the investor can submit disputes
to arbitration only "if these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months
following the date of the written notification" of the dispute. It further specifies that:

Disputes between one of the Parties and an investor of the other Party, in
connection with his investment, shall be notified in writing, including a detailed
information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the investment. As far as
possible, the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavour to settle these
disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith.

Bayindir contends that it has complied with the requirement of notice under Article VII of
the BIT by disputing the validity of various decisions of the Engineer (RA, p. 7,921)
and, by serving the Government of Pakistan with the “Constitutional Petition” on 26 April
2001 (Exh.[Bay.]CX 35, referred to in C-Mem. J., p. 51, $178). In substance, Bayindir
admits that this notice could be framed “more perfectly”, but contends that it “effectively
glalve notice” (Tr. J., 180:1 et seq.).

As shown at the jurisdictional hearing by Pakistan (Tr. J., 42:13 et seqg.), the notices
referred to in Bayindir’s RA were purely contractual notices to the Engineer with a view
to commencing arbitration under clause 67.1 of the Contract and cannot be assimilated
to a notice under Article VII(2) of the BIT?”.

As regards the Constitutional Petition, it is Bayindir’s contention that it “provided 20
pages of detailed information concerning the dispute between Bayindir and Pakistan”
(C-Mem. J., p. 51, 1 179). More specifically, Bayindir points out that in the Constitutional

The Tribunal notes that Bayindir seems to abandon the argument that it complied with the
requirement of notice by disputing the validity of various decisions of the Engineer (Ir. J.
180:13-18).

25

96.

Petition it complained that it had been treated "unilaterally, arbitrarily and illegally [...]
without [...] due process of law" and that the expulsion "appears to have been taken
under the dictates of [the Government of Pakistan] for ulterior motives" (C-Mem. J., p.
51, 9.180 referring to Exh. [Bay.] CX-35, p. 19 at xv).

Pakistan did not address this contention in its Reply. At the hearing on jurisdiction, it
adopted the following position:

But it is an interesting question in theory whether a constitutional petition in the
courts of a state is capable of amounting to the necessary notification as a
prelude to a good faith attempt to settle a dispute by negotiation. But this is a
constitutional petition that does not refer to the BIT. It could not remotely be
described as a notification in writing of a dispute under the BIT accompanied by
the appropriate detailed information.

(Tr. J., p. 74:25-33)

Although it is true that — unlike other treaties and in particular NAFTA — “[t]here is no
requirement in the BIT that such written notice refer either to the BIT or BIT breaches”
(C-Mem. J., p. 51, 9180), the fact remains that the Constitutional Petition was not filed
in view of a dispute under the Treaty. Moreover, as correctly pointed out by Pakistan,
the Constitutional Petition could hardly rely on the BIT since the BIT itself is not part of
the law of Pakistan (Tr. J., 216.15-16 referring (implicitly) to Tr. J., 192:3-5).

 

 

 

This being said, the Tribunal does not need to make a definitive ruling on the
‘theoretical’ question of whether a constitutional petition in the courts of a State may
serve as a notice under a BIT. Nor does the Tribunal need to rule on the more practical
question whether, in Bayindir’s terms, “when one looks closely at the constitutional
petition one can spell out” the necessary information required under Article 7 of the BIT
(Tr._J., 182:13-16) or, more generally, whether these requirements constitute “a
necessary ingredient of the notice provision” (Tr. J., 182:20-21). In the Tribunal’s view,

 

the requirement of notice contained in Article VII of the BIT should not be interpreted as
a precondition to jurisdiction.

Determining the real meaning of Article VII of the BIT is a matter of interpretation.

Pursuant to the general principles of interpretation set forth in Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties, and consistently with the practice of previous ICSID

26

97.

98.

tribunals dealing with notice provisions”, this Tribunal considers that the real meaning
of Article VII of the BIT is to be determined in the light of the object and purpose of that

provision.

The parties made extensive submissions on what the correct interpretation of Article VII
of the BIT should be:

(i) In Pakistan’s view, the notice requirement constitutes a “carefully crafted”
limitation of the consent given by the parties to the BIT offering the foreign
investor a direct right of recourse to international arbitration against the
defendant state (Tr. J., 72:3-12). Hence, Article VII is a mandatory provision
and the parties have a “real obligation” to endeavour to settle their dispute
within the six months periods (Tr. J.. 213:16 et seg.). Accordingly the notice
requirement is to be interpreted as a precondition to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal, which if it is not met, bars the non-complying party from commencing
arbitration: it is not only a procedural matter, “it does go to jurisdiction” (Tr. J..
71:37-72:2).

 

(ii) According to Bayindir, the purpose of the notice requirement is “to allow the
possibility of an agreed settlement before formal proceedings” (Tr. J., 184:15-
17) “in a way rather of exhortation than compulsion for the parties to see
whether they can resolve the dispute by negotiations” (Ir. J., 186:21-23).
Accordingly, “[t]hese provisions should be regarded as ones that do not disable
the next level in the process" (Tr. J., 186:38-187:17"). In other words, the non
fulfilment of the notice requirement should “not b[e] regarded as a bar” (Tr. J..
188:3) to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

 

 

The Tribunal notes that Pakistan has not denied that the main purpose of Article VII of
the BIT is to provide for the possibility of a settlement of the dispute. In the Tribunal’s
view, the purpose of the notice requirement is to allow negotiations between the parties
which may lead to a settlement. Significantly, Article VII(2) does not read, if these
disputes “are not settled” within six months but "cannot be settled” within six months,
which wording implies an expectation that attempts at settlement are made. Faced with
a similar situation, the tribunal in Salini v. Morocco refused to adopt a formalistic

See, for instance, L.E.S./. v. Algeria [supra Fn. 26], 932. In L.E.S./. v. Algeria the tribunal
considered the purpose of the notice provision to hold that one could not require that the notice
contains more than the general framework of the claim: “// n'est nulle part exigé que cette
requéte comprenne d'autres éléments, qui seraient de toute fagon étrangers au but poursuivi par
la régle” (see L.E.S.I. v. Algeria [supra Fn. 26], J] 32(iii)).

101.

approach and stated that an attempt to reach amicable settlement implies merely “the
existence of grounds for complaint and the desire to resolve these matters out-of

court’?,

Pakistan itself admits that the notice requirement cannot constitute a prerequisite for
jurisdiction when the necessary “steps [...] are impossible to take in the circumstances

 

of the case” (Ir. 72:20-24). In the specific setting of investment arbitration,

 

international tribunals tend to rely on the non-absolute character of notice requirements
to conclude that waiting period requirements do not constitute jurisdictional provisions
but merely procedural rules that must be satisfied by the Claimant*’:

Compliance with such a requirement is, accordingly, not seen as amounting to a
condition precedent for the vesting of jurisdiction.

The Tribunal agrees with the view that the notice requirement does not constitute a
prerequisite to jurisdiction. Contrary to Pakistan’s position, the non-fulfilment of this
requirement is not “fatal to the case of the claimant” (Tr. J.. 222:34). As Bayindir pointed

 

out, to require a formal notice would simply mean that Bayindir would have to file a new
request for arbitration and restart the whole proceeding, which would be to no-one’s
advantage (Tr. J.. 184:18 et seq.).

The Tribunal is reinforced in this conclusion by the undisputed fact that on 4 April 2002,
Bayindir notified the Government of Pakistan that it was compelled to commence ICSID
arbitration regarding the "serious disputes in connection with the investments made by
Bayindir" given that its efforts to negotiate had "failed to bear fruit" (Exh. [Bay.] B-40).
Pakistan did not respond to this letter by pointing to the requirement of notice and the
obligation to endeavour to reach a settlement contained in Article VII of the BIT.
Similarly, in its first response to Bayindir’s RA, Pakistan did not rely on Article VII of the
BIT but heavily insisted on the fact that Bayindir “had already filed three (3) suits in the

courts of law in Pakistan”®*. It was the ICSID Secretariat, on 14 June 2002, which
raised the issue asking Bayindir to provide further information and documentation
regarding “the fulfilment of the condition set forth at the beginning of Article VII(2) [...]
as it appears that the first notice mentioning the BIT was made on April 4, 2002”**. Two
weeks later, on 28 June 2002, Pakistan wrote to the Centre to challenge its jurisdiction
without making any mention of the requirements of Article VII of the BIT®.

The Tribunal further notes that Pakistan made no proposal to engage in negotiations
with Bayindir following Bayindir’s notification of 4 April 2002, which made an explicit
reference to the failure of the efforts to negotiate. In the Tribunal’s view, if Pakistan had
been willing to engage in negotiations with Bayindir, in the spirit of Article VII of the BIT,
it would have had many opportunities to do so during the six months following the
Notification of 4 April 2002°°. Along the lines of the award rendered in Lauder v. The
Czech Republic, the Tribunal is prepared to find that preventing the commencement of
the arbitration proceedings until six months after the 4 April 2002 notification would, in
the circumstances of this case, amount to an unnecessary, overly formalistic approach
which would not serve to protect any legitimate interests of the Parties®” and hold “that
the six-month waiting period in [the BIT] does not preclude it from having jurisdiction in

the present proceedings”.

As a result of this conclusion, the Tribunal will not discuss Bayindir’s additional
argument pursuant to which it would be entitled to disregard the notice requirement of
Article VIl of the BIT by virtue of the operation of the most favoured nation clause
contained in Article II(2) of the BIT.

2002 NHA filed an unsolicited response referring for the first time to Article VII of the BIT noting
that “no mention of the BIT was ever made by Bayindir ‘the Contractor’ in their correspondence
regarding amicable settlement of disputes” and emphasizing that Bayindir letter of 4 April was
addressed to Pakistan, “and not to NHA”. It was only in the beginning of 2003 that NHA relied for
the first time on Article VII of the BIT (see letter of NHA to the Centre of 2 January 2003).]

The Tribunal notes that in /mpregilo, “immediately after the registration of Impregilo’s first
request for arbitration by ICSID, negotiations took place between the Parties on the initiative of
the Pakistan Minister of Finance” (Impregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74], {| 44).

HAs BAYINDIR MADE AN INVESTMENT?

Pakistan’s first objection to jurisdiction is based on the alleged lack of an investment
within the meaning of Article I(2) of the BIT (a) and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention

(b) (Mem. J., p. 1 at (iv)).
Investment under Article I(2) of the BIT

It is common ground between the parties that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is contingent
upon Bayindir having made an investment within the meaning of the BIT. Article I(2) of
the BIT defines investment as follows:

The term “investment, in conformity with the hosting Party's laws and
regulations, shall include every kind of asset, in particular, but not exclusively:

(a) Shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies

(b) returns reinvested, claims to money or any other rights to legitimate
performance having financial value related to an investment,

(c) moveable and immoveable property, as well as any other rights in rem such
as mortgages, liens, pledges and any other similar rights,

() [1]

(e) business concessions conferred by law, or by contract, including

concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources on
the territory of each Party as defined hereinafter.

The parties first disagree on the meaning of the phrase “in conformity with the hosting
Party's laws and regulations” following the “investment* in Article I(2). On the one hand,
Bayindir argues that the requirement of conformity is meant “to exclude investments
that have been made in violation of local law from the treaty’s protection” and has no
bearing on the definition of the term investment itself (C-Mem. J.. p. 20). By contrast,
Pakistan contends that this phrase limits the definition of investment under the BIT to
“investment within the laws and regulations of Pakistan” (Mem J., p. 10 {| 2.6).

Pakistan further asserts that Bayindir has obtained the authorisation by the Pakistan
Board of Investment to engage in the construction work upon an express representation
that it was not making an investment (Mem. J., p. 11-13), so that “there has been no
investment for the purposes of the laws and regulations of Pakistan as required by

Article |(2)” of the BIT (Mem. J., p. 14, 1.2.12).

For the purpose of deciding on its jurisdiction, the Tribunal does not need to determine
the exact legal significance of Bayindir's statements before the Pakistan Board of

30

109.

110.

111.

112.

Investment (as well as Pakistan’s own statements that Bayindir did actually invest in
Pakistan*). In and of itself the representation that Bayindir was not making an
investment given for the purposes of obtaining an authorisation by the Board of
Investment does not mean that the activity of Bayindir does not qualify as an investment
under Pakistani laws. Moreover, Pakistan does not set forth any domestic laws or
regulations providing for a specific definition of investment.

In any event, the Tribunal cannot see any reason to depart from the decision of the
tribunal in Salini v. Morocco holding that “this provision [i.e., the requirement of
conformity with local laws] refers to the validity of the investment and not to its
definition’’’. The mere fact that in Salini the phrase “in accordance with” qualified the
words “assets invested” and not the term “investment” is not a sufficient basis to
distinguish Salini, contrary to Pakistan’s suggestion (Mem. J., p. 10, Fn. 17). Indeed,
the Salini holding refers explicitly to the “investment” and not to the “assets invested”.

Since Pakistan does not contend that Bayindir’s purported investment actually violates
Pakistani laws and regulations, the Tribunal considers that the reference to the “hosting
Party's laws and regulations” in Article I(2) of the Treaty could not in any case oust the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction in the present case.

Accordingly, the question boils down to whether Bayindir made an investment within the
meaning of Article (2) of the BIT. Before listing a non exhaustive series of examples,
Article |(2) provides as a general definition that investment “shall include every kind of
assets”.

Quoting a publication by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD)"", Bayindir contends that the indication “that investment includes ‘every kind

See the instances cited by Bayindir in C-Mem. J., pp. 25-26, 1 85.

Salini v. Morocco [supra No. 98], 9/46. Neither the fact that the regularity-validity of the
investment under the host state law is specifically dealt with in another provision of the Treaty
(namely Article 1I(1) and (2)) nor the fact that in Salini the provision qualified the words ‘assets
invested’ and not ‘the term investment’, provides sufficient grounds to depart from the Salini
reasoning.

of asset’ suggest[s] that the term embraces everything of economic value, virtually

without limitation” (C-Mem. J., p. 17, 1.57).

The Tribunal agrees with Bayindir that the general definition of investment of Article I(2)
of the Treaty is very broad. On a comparative basis, it has been suggested that the
reference to “every kind of asset” is “[p]ossibly the broadest” among similar general
definitions contained in BITs”.

Bayindir submits that its contributions in terms of know-how, equipment and personnel
(aa) and financing (bb) qualify as a Treaty investment under this broad definition.

Bayindir’s contribution in terms of know-how, equipment and personnel

Bayindir alleges that it has trained approximately 63 engineers, and provided significant
equipment and personnel to the Motorway.

On the facts of the case, this cannot be seriously disputed. Bayindir’s contribution in
terms of know how, equipment and personnel clearly has an economic value and falls
within the meaning of “every kind of asset” according to Article I(2) of the BIT.

Indeed, Pakistan’s objections concern mainly the purely financial contribution of
Bayindir.

Bayindir’s financial contribution

According to Pakistan, Bayindir did not make any significant injections of funds that
could be considered as an investment. Referring to Clause 60.8 of the Contract's
Conditions of Particular Application (as amended by Addenda Nos. 6 and 8 [of
1993]) and to Clause 3 of Addendum No. 9 of 17 April 2000, Pakistan relies upon the
following considerations:

[Bayindir] received almost one-third of the Contract price up front, which more
than adequately covered mobilisation costs. In this respect, it is recalled that as
of April 2001, Bayindir had retained approximately $100 million of the

 

Investment, according to which, exactly as in the BIT at hand, the term investment shall mean
“every kind of asset”.

mobilisation advance. At the same time, the risk engaged was minimal because
Bayindir had received such a substantial mobilisation advance, which it was to
retain (proportionally reduced) until the end of the Contract (Mem. J., pp. 15-16).

The very fact that a part of the price is paid in advance has in and of itself no bearing on
the existence of a financial contribution. In any event, Pakistan’s contention overlooks
the fact that Bayindir provided bank guarantees equivalent to the amount of the
Mobilisation Advance payable to NHA “on his first demand without whatsoever right of
objection on our part and without his first claim[ing] to the Contractor” (see supra No.
18). Specifically, Pakistan did not dispute Bayindir’s allegation that it “has incurred bank
commission charges in excess of USD 11 million” (C-Mem. J., p. 19 1.33).

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that Bayindir made a substantial
financial contribution to the Project.

Conclusion

Considering Bayindir’s contribution both in terms of know how, equipment and
personnel and in terms of injection of funds, the Tribunal considers that Bayindir did
contribute “assets” within the meaning of the general definition of investment set forth in
Article |(2) of the BIT.

Investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention

It is common ground between the parties that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is further
contingent upon the existence of an “investment” within the meaning of Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention (be it as an independent requirement or as a specification of the
concept of investment under the BIT).

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides the following:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out
of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or
agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in
writing to submit to the Centre.

The Tribunal notes that Bayindir claims that Pakistan has breached various rights
conferred on it by the BIT with respect to its investment. Hence, the current dispute is a
dispute with Pakistan, as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

33

125.

128.

Pakistan did not contest that the current dispute is a “legal dispute” within the meaning
of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention**. Irrespective of the possible nexus
between Bayindir’s claims under the BIT and the issues to be determined under the
underlying Contract, the fact remains that the present dispute is clearly legal in
nature as it concerns, in the words of the Report of the Executive Directors of the
World Bank on the Convention, “the existence or scope of [Bayindir's] legal rights”
and the nature and extent of the relief to be granted to Bayindir as a result of
Pakistan's violation of those legal rights“*.

Whether the rights asserted by Bayindir in the end are found to exist must await the
proceedings on the merits. Subject to determining whether Bayindir made an
investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which will be
discussed below, the Tribunal holds that the assertion of said rights has given rise to a
dispute that comes within the jurisdiction of the Centre as set out in Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention.

The object of the contract

First of all, Pakistan objects that, in the absence of express wording, a straightforward
highway construction contract does not constitute an investment under within Article 25
of the ICSID Convention (Mem. J., p. 8 referring to SCHREUER, op. cit. [supra Fn. 24], p.
139, footnote 158).

The Tribunal is unpersuaded by this objection. The construction of a highway is more
than construction in the traditional sense. As noted by the tribunal in Aucoven, the
construction of a highway, “which implies substantial resources during significant

In fact, Pakistan disputes the characterization of the legal dispute (see, for instance, Tr. J. 207:7-
17: “We do not conceal the fact that there is a real dispute between Bayindir and NHA about
this, there is not question about that at all. But it is not a dispute about breach of treaty; it is a
dispute about whether the exercise of a contractual power was justified under this term of the
contract, or whether instead the contracting party should have acted under a different
contractual provision and on payment of compensation. With the very greatest respect to
Bayindir and its representatives, there is no way of turning that into a claim for breach of treaty”).

periods of time, clearly qualifies as an investment in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID

Convention”®.

The Tribunal is reinforced in this conclusion by the fact, referred to by Bayindir, that in
the recent Impregilo case, which regarded a similar dispute concerning the construction
of a dam, Pakistan did not challenge the existence of an investment under Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention.“

The so-called “Salini Test”

Both parties relied upon previous decisions by ICSID Tribunals to define the notion of
investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and in particular upon the decision
in Salini v. Morocco’”, The Tribunal in Salini held that the notion of investment
presupposes the following elements: (a) a contribution, (b) a certain duration over which
the project is implemented, (c) sharing of the operational risks, and (d) a contribution to
the host State’s development, being understood that these elements may be closely

interrelated, should be examined in their totality,“

and will normally depend on the
circumstances of each case“®. In the following paragraphs the Tribunal will examine

these conditions in turn.

Firstly, to qualify as an investment, the project in question must constitute a substantial
commitment on the side of the investor. In the case at hand, it cannot be seriously
contested that Bayindir made a significant contribution, both in terms of know how,
equipment and personnel and in financial terms (see supra Nos. 115 et seq.).

Secondly, to qualify as an investment, the project in question must have a certain
duration. The element of duration is the paramount factor which distinguishes
investments within the scope of the ICSID Convention and ordinary commercial

transactions. When denying the qualification of investment to an ordinary sales contract
(even if complex), the Tribunal in Joy Mining expressly distinguished Salini v. Morocco
on the ground that “[i]n that case, however, a major project for the construction of a
highway was involved and this indeed required not only heavy capital investment but

also services and other long-term commitments.”

Bayindir points out that the Contract had an initial duration of three years followed by a
defect liability period of one year and a maintenance period of four years against
payment. It is further undisputed that the project had been underway for three years
and that Bayindir was granted a contractual extension of an additional twelve months.
Contracts over similar periods of time have been considered to satisfy the duration test
for an investment®'. Since Pakistan has not contended that the project was not
sufficiently extended in time to qualify as an investment, the Tribunal considers that this
requirement is met. More generally, as mentioned by the tribunal in L.E.S./. v. Algeria,
one cannot place the bar very high, as (a) experience shows — and a preliminary
assessment of the facts of the case seem to confirm — that this kind of project more
often than not requires time extensions, and (b) the duration of the contractor's
guarantee should also be taken into account”.

Thirdly, to qualify as an investment, the project should not only provide profit but also

imply an element of risk. Pakistan’s argument in this respect is that “the risk engaged

was minimal because Bayindir had received such a substantial mobilisation advance,

which it was to retain (proportionally reduced) until the end of the Contract” (Mem. J.
2.19, p. 16).

 

Bayindir contested this argument, inter alia, on the ground that it had placed itself at
considerable risk by securing first demand bank guarantees, and by opening itself to
the danger of an unlawful call on the guarantees. More generally (C-Mem. J., 9.41
p. 13). Bayindir relied on the following passage of the Salini decision:

Joy Mining v. Egypt [supra Fn. 49], J] 62.

Salini v. Morocco [supra No. 98], {1 54-55, citing D. CARREAU ef al., Droit International

excessivement rigoureux tant l’expérience apprend que des objets du genre de celui qui est en
cause justifient souvent des prolongations, sans parler de la durée de la garantie.”

36

137.

138.

139.

It does not matter in this respect that these risks were freely taken. It also does
not matter that the remuneration of the Contractor was not linked to the
exploitation of the completed work. A construction that stretches out over many
years, for which the total cost cannot be established with certainty in advance,
creates an obvious risk for the Contractor.°°

The Tribunal cannot agree with Pakistan’s objection. Besides the inherent risk in long-
term contracts, the Tribunal considers that the very existence of a defect liability period
of one year and of a maintenance period of four years against payment, creates an
obvious risk for Bayindir. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal is of the opinion that
Bayindir's participation in the risks of the operation was significant.

Lastly, relying on the preamble of the ICSID Convention, ICSID tribunals generally
consider that, to qualify as an investment, the project must represent a significant
contribution to the host State’s development. In other words, investment should be
significant to the State’s development. As stated by the tribunal in L.E.S./, often this
condition is already included in the three classical conditions set out in the ‘Salini test’®>.
In any event, in the present case, Pakistan did not challenge the numerous declarations
of its own authorities emphasising the importance of the road infrastructure for the
development of the country.

For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Bayindir made an investment
both under Article 1(2) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly,
Pakistan’s jurisdictional challenge that there is no investment fails.

ARE BAYINDIR’S TREATY CLAIMS IN REALITY CONTRACT CLAIMS?

It is Pakistan’s “primary submission” (Ir. J., 209:36) that “Bayindir’s (treaty) claims,

 

however skilfully repackaged, are inextricably bound up with the Contract” (Reply J.
p. 3 2.2) and that “the only rights which Bayindir claims have been violated are rights
which it asserts are derived from the Contract” (Reply J., p. 21, 4.2.44). In other words,

regardless of how they have been formulated in this arbitration, Bayindir’s Treaty

143.

Claims “are in reality contract claims [...] and thus beyond the scope of this tribunal's
jurisdiction” (Tr. J., 45:24-27).

 

In response, Bayindir relies on the above-mentioned ‘precedent’ in the /mpregilo case,
in which Pakistan was unsuccessful with this very same argument to object to
jurisdiction®’. As pointed out by Bayindir, the tribunal in Impregilo held, inter alia, as
follows:

The fact that Article 9 of the BIT does not endow the Tribunal with jurisdiction to
consider Impregilo's Contract Claims does not imply that the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to consider Treaty Claims against Pakistan which at the same time
could constitute breaches of the Contracts. **

And the tribunal added:

[C]ontrary to Pakistan's approach in this case, the fact that a breach may give
rise to a contract claim does not mean that it cannot also — and separately — give
rise to a treaty claim.®°

In substance Bayindir contends that it has laid out in some detail its claims for the
breach of four separate BIT provisions and has thus, in the words of the /mpregilo
tribunal, properly stated a claim "that the alleged damages were a consequence of the
behaviour of the Host State acting in breach of the obligations it had assumed under the
treaty” (Rejoinder J., pp. 18-19, 157°). Before discussing in more detail the difference
between Treaty Claims and Contract Claims (b) under the specific circumstances of the
case (c) and Pakistan’s subsidiary arguments in this respect (qd), it is useful to recall the
actual formulation of Bayindir’s Treaty Claims (a).

Bayindir’s Treaty Claims

In its RA, Bayindir submitted that Pakistan’s conduct in connection with the project
constituted:
[b]latant violation of its obligations to Bayindir under the BIT. In particular,
Pakistan has allegedly:

- failed to promote and protect Bayindir's investment in violation of Article II of
the BIT;

In Impregilo, Pakistan submitted that “the Treaty Claims [t]here c[ould] not be separated from the
Contract Claims and that, consequently, such claims fall outside the scope of the BIT and this
Tribunal has no jurisdiction over them” (see /mpregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74], | 77).

- failed to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of Bayindir's investment, in
violation of Article II (2) of the BIT;

- taken measures of expropriation, or measures having the same nature or the
same effect, against Bayindir's investment in violation of Article Ill (1) of the
BIT.

(RA, p. 14 136-37)

In its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Bayindir expanded on the alleged violation of
Article Il (2) of the BIT explaining that this provision contained an obligation of both
national and most favoured nation treatment. Bayindir’s Treaty Claims are of three
types:

(i) claims for violation of Pakistan’s obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment
(based on the BIT’s preamble and indirectly on Article II(2) of the BIT);

(ii) claims for violations of Pakistan’s obligation to accord most favoured nation
treatment (based directly on Article II(2) of the BIT);

(iii) claims for expropriation (based directly on Article III(1) of the BIT).

At the jurisdictional hearing Bayindir summarized its case in the following terms:

We assert that we entered bona fide a substantial contract for the construction of
a motorway, the contract having been entered with the NHA, in terms which
undoubtedly as it seems to be common ground, would provide a profitable
contractual enterprise for us as a substantial contractor to provide a result which
in the circumstances was at a tender price some 30 per cent less than any other
tender for this substantial project. We expected no more than to be treated fairly
and without discrimination as we executed our contract pursuant to the
arrangements which we made with the NHA. Our complaint is that for reasons
external to our contractual performance it became convenient to the
Respondent, the Republic of Pakistan, acting in its own behalf and also, we say,
through its emanation, NHA, to terminate their contractual arrangement before
the completion of the project.

(Tr. J., 126:16:32)

 

There can be no dispute that these claims are directly stated by reference to Pakistan's
obligations under the BIT. In and of themselves, assuming pro tem that they may be
sustained on the facts, Bayindir’s Treaty Claims fall within the scope of the BIT. This
being so, the following aspects are, however, disputed:

(a) whether Bayindir’s Treaty Claims are in reality Contract Claims or, in other words
whether there is any “credible self-standing Treaty Claim” (Mem. J., p. 5 1.7);

(b) whether Bayindir’s Treaty Claims are sufficiently substantiated;

39

147.

148.

149.

(c) whether the actions about which Bayindir’s complains were taken in the exercise
of puissance publique.

Pakistan summarized its objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear Bayindir’s
Treaty Claims as follows:

Bayindir's claims for breach of the treaty are claims that its rights under the
Contract have been interfered with or abrogated. It follows that in the present
case (and it is not suggested that this will invariably be the case whenever there
is a combination of contract and treaty claims in an investment dispute), if the
claims for breach of contract are unsuccessful, because it is determined that
Bayindir did not possess the rights which it claims or (which amounts to the
same thing) that abrogation of those rights was contractually justified, then the
treaty claims must also fail.

(Reply J., p. 18, 12.39)

The difference between Treaty Claims and Contract Claims

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that Pakistan accepts that “treaty claims are
juridically distinct from claims for breach of contract, even where they arise out of the
same facts” (Reply J., p. 18, 2.38). The Tribunal considers that this principle is now

well established®'. The ad hoc committee in Vivendi v. Argentina described this

962

“conceptual separation””* as follows:

A particular investment dispute may at the same time involve issues of the
interpretation and application of the BIT’s standards and questions of contract.

Whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a
breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be
determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law in the case of the
BIT, by international law, in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper
law of the contract.**

The Vivendi ad hoc Committee went on to state:

[W]here “the fundamental basis of the claim” is a treaty laying down an
independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the

existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause [or, for present purpose, an
arbitration clause®] in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state
or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty
standard.

And:

In a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an international
tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of
forum clause in the contract.

In the present case, it is undisputed that the 1997 Contract contains a dispute
settlement clause providing for arbitration under the 1940 Arbitration Act of Pakistan.

As a matter of principle, this arbitration clause is irrelevant for the purpose of the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal over the Treaty Claims®’. However, following the withdrawal
of the Contract Claims, Pakistan argues that, under the particular circumstances of this
case, “to use the language of the award in the Vivendi Annulment case, the essential
basis of [Bayindir’s] claims is purely contractual” (Tr. J.. 45:22-26).

 

The specific circumstances of the case

On Pakistan’s case, the Treaty Claims are purely contractual as they:

[c]oncern [aa.] the interpretation and application of contract provisions, to what
extent and whether the contract was breached by either NHA or Bayindir,
whether and to what extent the engineer's decisions as to which Bayindir's
claims are ultimately directed were justified and [bb.] how any claim should be
quantified under the contract's provisions”.

(Tr. J.. 45:22-26).

In other words, the Treaty Claims are in reality contract claims (over which the Tribunal
does not have jurisdiction) because (aa) their ‘ingredients’ are essentially contractual
which is confirmed by the fact that (bb) the amount of the Treaty Claims corresponds to
the amount of the Contract Claims.

See, for instance 90-91.

on Jurisdiction of 11 May 2005, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/camuzzi-
en.pdf, 89, where the tribunal seems to limit the relevance of the contractual forum only to
“purely contractual questions having no effect on the provisions of the Treaty”.

a4

aa. The “ingredients” of Bayindir’s claims

154. In substance, Pakistan’s case is that the Treaty Claims are in reality dependent upon
the existence of a breach of contract:

The right not to be the victim of unfair and inequitable treatment, the right not to
be the victim of expropriation, are both rights that are tied to specific substantive
rights of an investor, and one has to ask what has been interfered inequitably or
unfairly; what has been taken in an expropriation? [...] it is logically and
juridically essential to establish that Bayindir has the rights under the contract
that it claims to have before it will even be possible to determine whether those
rights have been the subject of expropriation.

(Tr. J., 85:3-8; 85:30-34).

155. Bayindir acknowledges that its case arises out of the contractual relationship but insists
on the fact that its claims rest on breaches of the BIT:

[I]t is difficult to contemplate, although one can postulate, a situation for breach
of a BIT obligation that would not be some underlying contractual situation
supporting the circumstances that have given rise to the claim for a breach of the
treaty obligation. So the fact that one can identify a particular contractual
relationship is a usual, one would say almost inevitable, precursor to any aspect
of a claim arising from the breach of a BIT obligation.

(Tr. J., 126:7-15)

156. On the expropriation claim in particular, Pakistan further argues that:

Bayindir's expropriation claim, what it now terms an expropriation claim, as well
as all of its claims which are based on its expulsion from the site, can only be
assessed in the light of the contract's terms and taking into account their actual
application in fact, including an assessment of whether Bayindir was responsible
for insufficient progress on the works, the actions and decision of the engineer
and the contractually based qualification of any amounts potentially owing to
Bayindir for work performed or for its fixed and moveable assets on the site
under the contract, and those are all quintessentially contractual matters as to
which Pakistan respectfully submits this tribunal has no jurisdiction.

(Tr. J., 52:20-33)

157. The Tribunal is however of the opinion that the fact that a State may be exercising a
contractual right or remedy does not of itself exclude the possibility of a treaty breach
(see also infra Nos. 180 et seq.).

bb. The quantum of Bayindir’s claims

158. According to Pakistan, “the most striking indication [of the intrinsically contractual nature
of the Treaty Claims] is that the amount claimed in the present proceedings (US
$416,236,110) is exactly the same as that claimed by Bayindir in the proceedings it has

42

159.

160.

161.

initiated in Pakistan under the contractual provisions for arbitration” (Mem. J, p. 40
14.1) or in other words:

[T]he amount of Bayindir's claim quantified in its request for arbitration is
precisely to the dollar the same amount that Bayindir claim to the Engineer under
clause 53 of the contract. In and of itself that is a test to the fact that the
underlying basis for Bayindir's claims must be contractual.

(Tr. J. 47:17-23)

Bayindir's position is that, following the abandonment of the Contract Claims, “the issue
of what would have happened under the contract, which is not by definition before the
tribunal, is irrelevant”; since Bayindir is pursuing exclusively “treaty breach[es], all these
problems about damages fall away” (Tr. J., 146:14-22).

 

As Bayindir’s original Treaty and Contract Claims clearly arose out of the same set of
facts, it is not surprising that at the stage of the RA Bayindir articulated damages by
reference to the Contract. In the current situation, following the abandonment of its
Contract Claims, Bayindir is required to articulate the damage exclusively by reference
to the Treaty. In Bayindir’s counsel’s terms:

[O]ur complaint is a completely different complaint under a treaty, which has its
own measures of compensations. Once you get to that point we say that you
levitate yourself out of contract issues and come to the issue of if there is a
breach amounting to expropriation, what is the compensation.

(Tr. J.. 146:5-10)

 

At the jurisdictional hearing, Bayindir recognized that it has “not yet articulated” the
requested amount of compensation (Ir. J., 147:23-24) and qualified the articulation “by

reference to the issues about contract claims” as merely “a convenient reference point”
(Tr._J.. 145:16-17). Referring to the principles set out by the Permanent Court of

 

International Justice in the 1928 Chorzéw Factory case, Bayindir contends that
reparation must as far as possible wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and
re-establish the situation which in all possibility would have existed if that act had not
been committed. According to Bayindir, if it concludes that Pakistan breached the BIT,
the Tribunal will have to address the question of compensation according to these
principles. In Bayindir’s view, “it does not involve working through the contractual
provisions” (Tr. J. 143:7-8; see also Tr. J., 168:16-19), the “obvious elements of

 

compensation” being:

[o]ne loss of profit, which we say we can measure exactly here because of the
price at which the contract was let out to other contractors as well as in other
ways. We have the element, we say, of destruction of our corporate business
because of the hardship imposed by reason of this expulsion. We have the

43

162.

163.

164.

165.

issues, we say, of recouping unrecouped expenditure including amounts which
had not even been certified. We do not claim them because they have been
certified here; we just claim the set amounts we have spent and which are
entitled to be recouped as part of our losses. Fifthly, we would say that we
would be entitled to have appropriate orders indemnifying us completely against
a call up of these guarantees of 71.6 million and 1.87 billion rupees and other
customs and guarantees which even recently have been called up to put us in
the position we would have been if there had not been, for the purpose of this
argument, undoubted treaty breaches amounting to reparation.

(Tr. J. 144:28-145:8)

In and of itself, “Bayindir’s contemporaneous characterisation and pursuit of those
claims under the contract dispute resolution mechanism” (see. Tr. J., 54:18-21) — which
was described as “a self evident fact” by Bayindir (Tr. J.. 63:35-38; 64:1-10) — does not

 

 

mean that Bayindir’s current Treaty Claims are in reality Contract Claims.

In support of its case that the Treaty Claims are in reality Contract Claims, Pakistan
puts much weight on “[t]he fact that it is admitted by Bayindir that if they are completely
successful in the ICSID proceedings that will wipe out the totality of their contractual

claim” (Tr. J., 83:27-30).

Indeed, when abandoning its Contract Claims, Bayindir expressed the following views:

[Wle are pursuing our remedies on the basis that there is a treaty breach. If, as
we expect, we are successful in establishing liability with respect to that matter,
we would expect that our relief as claimed would provide complete relief for us
with respect to all matters arising out of the agreements made with respect to the
freeway. That would mean that there would be no outstanding issues to be
resolved.

(Tr. Ji, 12:11-19)

 

Moreover, as will be discussed below, at the jurisdictional hearing Bayindir further
submitted that the Contract Claims are in any event time barred under Pakistani law.
One may ask whether, under these circumstances, Bayindir’s re-articulation of the
claims and of the possible measure of compensation is legitimate. This is a question
that the Tribunal will address more generally when discussing Pakistan’s argument that
Bayindir’s procedural behaviour constitutes qualified “abuse of process” (cf. infra Nos.
169 et seq.). For the present purpose, the Tribunal must assess its jurisdiction on the
basis of the record as it stands. The fact remains that Bayindir is asserting Treaty
Claims and a newly articulated request for compensation, which may include “an

appropriate sum for compensation” (Tr. J., 147:33-38).

 

44

166.

167.

168.

aa.

169.

170.

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal holds that the present case is not a case
where the essential basis of the claims is purely contractual. Hence, there is no reason
to depart from the principle of the independence of treaty claims and contract claims as

it was expressed by the ad hoc Committee in Vivendi.

In conclusion, the Tribunal considers that when the investor has a right under both the
contract and the treaty, it has a self-standing right to pursue the remedy accorded by
the treaty. The very fact that the amount claimed under the treaty is the same as the
amount that could be claimed (or was claimed) under the contract does not affect such

self-standing right.

Pakistan’s subsidiary arguments

Having concluded that the Treaty Claims are independent from the Contract Claims, the
Tribunal will now review Pakistan’s two subsidiary objections to its jurisdiction to hear
the Treaty Claims, that is (aa) abuse of process and (bb) conflict of conventions.

Abuse of Process
At the jurisdictional hearing, Pakistan qualified Bayindir’s articulation of claims as an

“abuse of process [...] under international law with the BIT and the ICSID convention”
(Tr. J.. 34:4-32). In particular, Pakistan insisted on the following circumstances:

 

[R]eally almost up until the last minute before this dramatic request for arbitration
in the Spring of 2002 to ICSID, Bayindir treated all its complaints against NHA as
contractual complaints. There is not a hint of any complaint under any BIT
against Pakistan.

(Tr. J., 34:5-10)

Bayindir [became] unhappy with the dispute resolution mechanism it voluntarily
agreed with when it signed the contract and which was an essential part of the
bargain between NHA and Bayindir, and wants to re-write the contract and
effectively substitute this Tribunal for the Tribunal that it hitherto recognised was
the competent Tribunal.

(Tr. J., 65:35-66:3)

Pakistan asserts that there is an “inherent power and duty for an international Tribunal
to guard against this kind of abuse of process, and that that has had jurisdictional or at

least preliminary objections significance” (Tr. J., 83:37-84:2).

 

45

171.

172.

173.

bb.

174.

175.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, one should distinguish between Bayindir's tactical choice to
abandon the Contract Claims at the outset of the jurisdictional hearing and Bayindir’s
fundamental choice to pursue the Treaty Claims. It is evident that Bayindir’s initial
choice to raise Contract Claims and its late withdrawal of these Claims may have
engendered a significant amount of useless work for both the Tribunal and Pakistan.
Whether Bayindir's late abandonment of the Contract Claims should have an incidence

on the allocation of costs will be addressed below (cf. infra Nos. 276 et seq.).

The same can be said of Bayindir’s contention that, on the basis of the “relevant
limitation periods under the law of Pakistan, there are no contract claims being
maintained by the claimant in arbitration or in legal proceedings in Pakistan nor is there
a possibility that any contract claims could be maintained because they are out of time”
(Ir. J., 229:7-11). If the Tribunal can only regret that this submission was made at the

 

very end of the jurisdictional hearing, this does not make Bayindir's pursuit of the Treaty
Claims abusive.

Hence, the Tribunal dismisses Pakistan’s challenge to its jurisdiction to the extent it is

based on an alleged abuse of process.

Conflict of Conventions

At the hearing on jurisdiction, Pakistan put forward a new argument: Pakistan’s recent
ratification of the 1958 New York Convention which brings with it “Pakistan's obligations
to respect and to enforce a private arbitration agreement” under Article Il of the New
York Convention (Tr. J., 28:
the 1958 New York Convention and the 1965 Washington Convention” and argues that

 

-32). Pakistan relies on a “potential conflict between [...]

 

“the New York Convention both historically and because of its specialist terms should
be preferred to the Washington Convention” (Ir. J., 28:34-29:8). It is Pakistan’s
submission that the Tribunal should avoid “creat[ing] a situation where by thwarting the

 

private arbitral process [it] induce[s] a breach of Pakistan's treaty obligations both to
Turkey and to all other ratifiers of the New York Convention” (Tr. J.. 29:11-15).

 

The Tribunal cannot conceal its surprise at the raising of this argument, which it
considers devoid of merit. Along the lines of the /mpregilo decision as quoted by
Pakistan itself, the Tribunal considers that, as the current proceedings are not

46

176.

177.

178.

concerned with the Contract Claims, the issue of “the impact (if any) of competing
arbitration agreements, including all questions as to the viability of such provisions,
does not arise” (/mpregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74], ] 85 referred to in Tr. J., 118:9-
119:15)°,

 

In any event, Pakistan’s point regarding a potential conflict of conventions might only
arise if an ICSID tribunal were to order a state to disregard a local arbitration
agreement, contrary to Article Il of the New York Convention which obliges states to
“recognise an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to
arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them”
. 117:18-21).

 

(see Tr.

 

It is true that, at a time when this arbitration was still concerned with the Contract
Claims, Bayindir applied to obtain preliminary measures in order to stay the Islamabad
arbitration. It then withdrew its request as a result of an offer by Pakistan to request
NHA to move for an extension of time limits in such a manner that that arbitration would
not proceed prior to this Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction (see PO#1, p. 23). It has
always been the common understanding that Pakistan agreed to this measure in a
“spirit of co-operation” (Tr. J., 116:4) and there is no question that Pakistan will not be
bound by its commitment following the Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction. In any event,
the mere stay of the arbitration would not under any circumstances amount to a non-
recognition of the arbitration agreement in violation of Article Il of the New York
Convention.

Moreover, Pakistan's ratification of the New York Convention in the course of the
present proceedings cannot have any bearing on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the
present case. The contrary would entail, amongst other things, that a unilateral act by
the respondent to an arbitral proceeding could retrospectively affect (to the
respondent's own benefit) the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction which, according to the long-
established jurisprudence of international tribunals of all kinds, is fixed as of the time the
proceedings are commenced, and is not subject to ex post facto alteration®.

This Tribunal is aware that a conflict of convention argument was put forward by Pakistan in
Impregilo, but is unable to find any endorsement of such argument in the /mpregilo Tribunal’s
brief remark just quoted.

Again, the Tribunal notes that Pakistan put forward a similar argument in /mpregilo. However, it
observes that, contrary to the present one, /mpregilo was a case in which the allegedly

47

179.

180.

181.

182.

183.

As a result, the Tribunal cannot see any merit in Pakistan’s argument regarding the
potential conflict of conventions.

The question of ‘puissance publique’

Having held that a contractual breach may give rise to a separate treaty claim, the
tribunal in /mpregilo added that:

[oJ]nly the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority (“puissance publique’),
and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the
BIT. In other words, the investment protection treaty only provides a remedy to
the investor where the investor proves that the alleged damages were a
consequence of the behaviour of the Host State acting in breach of the
obligations it had assumed under the treaty. ”

On Pakistan’s case, almost all of the allegations which make up Bayindir's claim for
breach of treaty (whether relating to claims of discriminatory treatment, unfair and
inequitable treatment, or expropriation) concern the conduct of NHA, which was
contractual and not sovereign in character. Moreover, Pakistan contends that

[elven if the possibility that some small part of NHA's actions could potentially be
characterised as sovereign, the fact that the overwhelming majority are self-
evidently acts of a contractual character demonstrates the essentially contractual
nature of the claim and the futility of this Tribunal proceeding until the contractual
forum has examined all of the contractual claims and pronounced upon them.

(Reply J.. p. 21, 12.43)

Bayindir’s argues that the record shows the exercise of sovereign power, i.e., a decision
“from the top down”, in which “the element of national interest [...] was the driving force
for the result of our expulsion and expropriation of our contract” (Tr. J., 170:9-23)”".

In the Tribunal’s view, the test of jpuissance publique’ would be relevant only if Bayindir
was relying upon a contractual breach (by NHA) in order to assert a breach of the BIT.”

 

contradictory treaty obligations (BIT versus Geneva Convention) were already binding on both
states well before the arbitral proceedings were brought.

Impregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74], J 85.

Similarly, the Tribunal does not have to decide on Bayindir’s argument that the tribunal in “RFCC
v. Morocco, which Impregilo cites, discussed "puissance publique" only in the context of fair and
equitable treatment and expropriation claims before it, while it did not apply the test to the
national treatment and MFN claims” (Reply J.. p. 17, 154 referring to Consortium RFCC v.
Royaume du Maroc, |\CSID N° ARB/00/6, Award of 22 December 2003, {J 52-53 (Exh. [Pak]L-8
= Exh. [Bay]CLEX 59); available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/rfcc-award.pdf).

The Tribunal notes that this view is not contrary to Impregilo and RFCC. The tribunal in Impregilo
referred to the concept of ‘puissance publique’ in respect of the question whether a “breach of an
investment contract can be regarded as a breach of a BIT” (/mpregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74],
{9 259-260). Similarly, RFCC v. Morocco (cited by the tribunal in /mpregilo) was concerned with

48

184.

185.

In the present case, Bayindir has abandoned the Contract Claims and pursues
exclusively Treaty Claims. When an investor invokes a breach of a BIT by the host
State (not itself party to the investment contract), the alleged treaty violation is by
definition an act of ‘puissance publique’. The question whether the actions alleged in
this case actually amount to sovereign acts of this kind by the State is however a
question to be resolved on the merits.

Hence, at this stage the real question is whether the Treaty Claims are sufficiently
substantiated for jurisdictional purposes or, in Pakistan’s words, whether they have a
“colourable basis”.

ARE BAYINDIR’S TREATY CLAIMS SUFFICIENTLY SUBSTANTIATED FOR JURISDICTIONAL
PURPOSES?

Significantly, Pakistan itself assimilates the issue whether the Treaty Claims are in
reality Contract Claims to the question whether the Treaty Claims are in fact sufficiently
substantiated for jurisdictional purposes:

So a Tribunal that is not the Tribunal chosen under the contract should not be
hearing this case, we say, unless it really is a treaty claim that is confronting it
and not a contract claim dressed up to look like something on breach of treaty.

The Impregilo case at paragraph 254 of the award makes very much this point
[...]. Having quoted both Oil Platforms and the arbitration award in
SGS/Philippines [...], at paragraph 254 the Tribunal goes on in these terms.
"The present Tribunal is in full agreement with the approach evident in this
jurisprudence. It reflects two complementary concerns. To ensure that courts
and Tribunals are not flooded with claims which have no chance of success or
may even be of an abusive nature [...] and equally to ensure that in considering
issues of jurisdiction courts and Tribunals do not go into the merits of cases
without sufficient prior debate."

(Tr. J., 81:33-82:15)

 

 

the questions of whether (i) the alleged contract breach could constitute an unfair and
inequitable treatment under the BIT, and (ii) the alleged bad performance of the contract could
amount to interference tantamount to expropriation. RFCC v. Morocco, [supra Fn. 71]: “L’Etat,
ou son émanation, peuvent s’étre comportés comme des cocontractants ordinaires ayant une
divergence d’approche, en fait ou en droit, avec I'investisseur. Pour que la violation alléguée du
contrat constitue un traitement injuste ou inéquitable au sens de |’Accord bilatéral, i! faut qu'elle
résulte d’un comportement exorbitant de celui qu’un contractant ordinaire pourrait adopter.”
(51). And further: “Or un Etat cocontractant n’ « interfére » pas, mais « exécute » un contrat.
Sil peut mal exécuter ledit contrat cela ne sera pas sanctionné par les dispositions du traité
relatives a I'expropriation ou a la nationalisation a moins qu'il ne soit prouvé que I'Etat ou son
émanation soit sorti(e) de son réle de simple cocontractant(e) pour prendre le réle bien
spécifique de Puissance Publique” (Ibid, | 65 ; see also | 69).

To answer the question whether the Treaty Claims are sufficiently substantiated for
jurisdictional purposes, the Tribunal will first define the relevant standard (a). It will then
apply it to the different Treaty Claims, i.e., the most favoured nation (MFN) claim (b),
the fair and equal treatment claim (c) and the expropriation claim (d).

The relevant test

According to Pakistan, Bayindir cannot merely allege breach of the BIT with a view to
establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Referring to previous decisions by international
tribunals, Pakistan submits that:

[i]t is for the Tribunal to interpret each provision of the BIT relied upon (Articles II
(1) and (2), III(1)), and to see whether on the facts alleged that provision could
be breached.

(Mem. J., p. 6, J. 1.9)

Pakistan accepts that the Tribunal need not determine whether Bayindir’s allegations of
breach are well-founded, but maintains that “some broad consideration of the facts may
be appropriate”. Specifically, Pakistan contends that:

Bayindir can only rely on allegations of fact (i) that are credible, (ii) where such
allegations could give rise to a breach of the BIT, (iii) taking into account the
views expressed by Pakistan on such allegations.

(Mem. J., p. 6, | 1.10)

Bayindir seems’* to accept that it has the burden (aa.) to demonstrate that the Tribunal
has jurisdiction (C-Mem. J., p. 3, (6). As to the standard of proof (bb.), Bayindir
seems” to accept that in the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration it has to establish
that “the claims it pleads are sustainable on a prima facie basis” (C-Mem. J., p. 3. 16).

The onus of establishing jurisdiction

In accordance with accepted international (and general national) practice, a party bears
the burden of proving the facts it asserts. In /mpregilo, the tribunal took it for granted

At the hearing, Bayindir expressed the following view: “Now, it is put that there is an onus on us
to establish jurisdiction. We say that is not so. We say that the onus is on Pakistan to establish
there is no jurisdiction but in the context that we have been firstly in our request for arbitration
expressed a tenable basis for putting a claim” (Tr. J., 138:38-140:5).

At the hearing, Bayindir expressed the following view: “We do not have to establish in our
submission a prima facie case, but we say whatever is the test we comfortably clear it” (Tr. J.
151:24-26).

 

50

191.

192.

bb.

193.

194.

that the Claimant had to satisfy “the burden of proof required at the jurisdictional phase”

and make “the prima facie showing of Treaty breaches required by ICSID Tribunals”.”°

At the jurisdictional hearing, Bayindir declared that it did not accept this passage of the
Impregilo decision (Tr. J., 13:34-36). Upon a specific request for clarification by the

 

Tribunal, Bayindir expressed the following view:
[I]t is necessary for this objection to be successful to the Republic of Pakistan to
say on this preliminary documentation that even if [Bayindir] establish the
matters and the characterisation of those matters which [it asserts], it becomes
untenable to make out [the Treaty] breach.

(Tr. J., 156:24-30)

 

In the Tribunal’s understanding, this approach does not alter the fact that, as conceded
in Bayindir's written submissions, Bayindir has the burden of demonstrating that its
claims fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The relevant standard

In their written submissions, the parties formulated the test which the Tribunal is to
apply in determining jurisdictional disputes in various ways. They made extensive
reference to decisions of the International Court of Justice, ICSID tribunals and other
international tribunals. The gap between their positions appeared to narrow down
through that written process and, at the jurisdictional hearing, counsel for both parties
accepted the following test stated by the tribunal in /mpregilo (Tr. J., 157:13 et seq.
Bayindir]; 198:31 et seg. [Pakistan]):

[T]he Tribunal has considered whether the facts as alleged by the Claimant in
this case, if established, are capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT
which have been invoked.”®

The tribunal in /mpregilo went on to explain that, applying the approach set out above,

the tribunal has to determine whether the “Treaty Claims fall within the scope of the BIT,

977

assuming pro tem that they may be sustained on the facts”’’. In other words, the

Impregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74], | 254, emphasis in the original

Impregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74], 263. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the
observation in United Parcel Service v. Government of Canada that “the reference to the facts
alleged being ‘capable’ of constituting a violation of the invoked obligations, as opposed to their
‘falling within’ the provisions, may be of little or no consequence. (United Parcel Service v.
Government of Canada (NAFTA), Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 November 200, {| 36; available at
http:/www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/UPS-Canada-Jurisdiction-22Nov2002.pdf.)

51

195.

196.

197.

Tribunal should be satisfied that, if the facts or the contentions alleged by Bayindir are
ultimately proven true, they would be capable of constituting a violation of the BIT.

The Tribunal notes that the approach has been followed by several international
arbitration tribunals deciding jurisdictional objections by a respondent state against a
claimant investor, including Methanex v. USA, SGS v. Philippines”®, Salini v. Jordan’®,
Siemens v. Argentina® and Plama v. Bulgaria®’. In the last of these cases, the tribunal
held that “if on the facts alleged by the Claimant, the Respondent's actions might violate

the [BIT], then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine exactly what the facts are and

82

see whether they do sustain a violation of that Treaty”™. Likewise, the tribunal in

Impregilo considered that “it must not make findings on the merits of those claims,

which have yet to be argued, but rather must satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction over the

dispute, as presented by the Claimant”®.

The Tribunal is in agreement with this approach, which strikes a helpful balance
between the need “to ensure that courts and tribunals are not flooded with claims which
have no chance of success or may even be of an abusive nature” on the one side, and
the necessity “to ensure that, in considering issues of jurisdiction, courts and tribunals
do not go into the merits of cases without sufficient prior debate” on the other.

Accordingly, the Tribunal’s first task is to determine the meaning and scope of the
provisions which Bayindir invokes as conferring jurisdiction and to assess whether the
facts alleged by Bayindir fall within those provisions or are capable, if proved, of

constituting breaches of the obligations they refer to™. In performing this task, the
Tribunal will apply a prima facie standard, both to the determination of the meaning and
scope of the BIT provisions and to the assessment whether the facts alleged may
constitute breaches. If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction will be established, but the
existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits.

Before applying this approach to each specific claim which Bayindir bases on the BIT,
the Tribunal notes that at the jurisdictional hearing Bayindir submitted that Pakistan
should have waited until the memorial on the merits before raising its jurisdictional
objections (Ir. J.. 141:4-5), which “of itself lowers the bar for [Bayindir] to clear” (Tr. J..
151:24-28).

 

It is true that under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41, Pakistan could have waited to raise its
objections on jurisdiction until its counter-memorial. However, this Rule also provides
that jurisdictional objections “shall be made as early as possible”. Moreover, as
Pakistan mentioned, Bayindir has explicitly accepted the way in which these
proceedings have been organised (Tr. J., 197:32-198:2). The reason for the exchange

 

of pleadings on jurisdiction prior to the memorial on the merits was to clear the question
of jurisdiction at an early stage. Bayindir knew the challenges brought forward by
Pakistan and had three opportunities to respond. At the first opportunity, Bayindir
submitted “that this Tribunal should consider whether the claims it pleads in the
jurisdictional phase of this arbitration are sustainable on a prima facie basis” (C-Mem.
J. p. 3,9 6).

The Tribunal therefore sees no reason to “lower the bar for [Bayindir] to clear” and thus
will apply the standard defined in paragraph 197 above.

Bayindir’s most favoured nation claim

Article Il (2) of the BIT states:

Each Party shall accord to these investments, once established, treatment no
less favourable than that accorded in similar situations to investments of its

Contrary to the tribunal in L.E.S./., this Tribunal will not simply verify that the Claimant invokes
treaty breaches (see L.E.S./. v. Algeria [supra Fn. 26], 25.4. The Tribunal observes that a
similar approach was adopted by the Tribunal in Consortium RFCC v. Royaume du Maroc,
Decision on jurisdiction, {| 70-71; available at http:/Awww.investmentclaims.com/decisions/-

investors or to investments of investors of any third country, which ever is the
most favourable.

It is Bayindir’s contention that its investment was not given treatment equivalent to the
best treatment accorded to a comparable Pakistani or third country investment.
Specifically, Bayindir alleged that (aa) it was expelled allegedly to save costs and for
reasons of local favouritism, considering in particular that (bb) far more favourable
timetables were accorded to Pakistani and other foreign contractors and that (cc) these
other contractors were not expelled even though they were behind schedule far more
than Bayindir.

Pakistan opposes this claim arguing (i) that Bayindir has not pleaded the MFN claim in
its RA, (ii) that Bayindir’s contentions do not amount to “an MFN national treatment type
claim’, and (iii) that Bayindir has “not show([n] enough to get this tribunal across the
threshold to establish a prima facie breach” (Tr. J., 100:11-24).

 

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal observes that the fact that the most favoured
nation claim was first brought forward only in Bayindir’s C-Mem. J. is not relevant per
se.

Pakistan further contends that MFN claims “are predominantly about regulatory action
where a local investor or a foreign investor is offered better treatment, i.e., a more
preferable regulatory treatment than the foreign investor”, which is clearly not the case
of Bayindir (Tr. J., 100:24-30). In other words, the obligation arising out of the most

 

favourable treatment clause concerns “regulatory protection not the exercise of
discretion where no legal obligation exists”, in particular in contractual matters:

The periods for the completion of the project and the employer's remedies for a
failure to complete on time, just like questions of remuneration, are matters that
fall within the scope of a given construction contract. [...] The fact that NHA may
not have terminated contracts in other cases is wholly irrelevant.

(Tr. J. 96:11-22)

The Tribunal disagrees. The mere fact that Bayindir had always been subject to exactly
the same legal and regulatory framework as everybody else in Pakistan does not
necessarily mean that it was actually treated in the same way as local (or third
countries) investors. In other words, as is evident from the broad wording of Article II(2)

54

207.

209.

of the BIT, the treatment the investor is offered under the MFN clause is not limited to

“regulatory treatment”®’.

Hence, the Tribunal will verify whether the facts alleged by Bayindir fall within this broad
wording of the MFN clause or would be capable if proved of constituting breaches
asserted. In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal will discuss this point in respect of
each of Bayindir’s contentions referred to above (cf. supra No. 202).

Expulsion for reasons of costs and local favouritism

In support of its allegation that it was expelled for reasons of costs and local favouritism,
Bayindir relies primarily on three articles published by the Pakistani newspaper “Dawn”

e A first article — published on 26 April 2002, that is three days after Bayindir’s
expulsion — quoting a spokesman for the NHA saying that "the project will now be
completed by the Pakistani construction companies [...] by December 31, 2002"

(Exh. [Bay.] CX 104).

e A second article, published on 7 May 2001, observing that the contract put the
country in a “difficult position in respect to foreign reserves” and suggesting that the
Prime Minister at the time of the revival of the contract “took personal interest to
ensure the execution of the project” (Exh. [Bay.] CX 98).

e A third article, published on 17 June 2001, quoting information from “official
sources” that “Islamabad is hoping to save several hundred million dollars by
executing the Islamabad-Peshawar motorway (M-1) project through local

construction firms” (Exh. [Bay.] CX 99).

According to Pakistan, these allegations are “false and unsubstantiated” (Reply J.. p.
70, 4.94). Pakistan did not indicate why and to what extent the information reported in
the press was not true but merely insisted on the fact that these press reports do not
constitute a sufficient basis to substantiate Bayindir's allegation for the purposes of
jurisdiction. Relying on the decisions of the International Court of Justice in the

Hostages case® and in Nicaragua®’, Pakistan affirms that international courts and
tribunals invariably treat such press reports with great caution and accept them merely
as corroborative evidence.

This Tribunal notes that the decisions cited in both the Hostages and Nicaragua cases
were concerned with decisions on the merits, to which the corresponding standard of
proof therefore applied. The position is obviously different where, as here, the tribunal is
merely applying a prima facie standard for the purpose of determining whether it has
jurisdiction.

Accordingly, irrespective of the evidentiary weight of these press reports on the merits,
the Tribunal considers that they constitute a sufficient basis for the purpose of
establishing jurisdiction. Additional elements support this prima facie basis. Indeed, in
connection with the Constitutional Petition, Pakistan submitted that the 1997 Contract
was a “bonanza” for Bayindir and was “highly favorable to the petitioner and against the
[...] economic and social interests of Pakistan” (Exh. [Bay.] CX 30). Moreover, Bayindir’s
alleged expulsion appears to have been decided after reports by the World Bank
indicating that the most economic course of action would be to stop the M1 Project (see
infra No. 247). Whatever the weight that they may carry when the Parties will have fully
briefed the merits and presented their evidence, at this preliminary stage these
elements are a sufficient basis to establish jurisdiction.

More favourable timetables were accorded to Pakistani contractors

Bayindir alleges that Pakistan breached the MFN clause because it awarded PMC JV,
the local contractor that replaced Bayindir, a four-year extra ‘time and space’, while it
was itself expelled having requested an EOT for a much shorter period. It also argues
that, although the project is still not terminated, the local contractor remains in place
and continues to benefit from Pakistan’s leniency as to delays.

217.

Having concluded that the MFN clause is not limited to regulatory treatment (see supra
Nos. 205-206), it is clear that awarding an extended timetable to the local investor can
fall within Article II(2) of the BIT.

Pakistan objects that:

[t]he periods for the completion of the project and the employer's remedies for a
failure to complete on time, just like questions of remuneration, are matters that
fall within the scope of a given construction contract. They are not matters of a
treaty.

(Tr. J., 96:11 et seg.

The Tribunal can certainly agree with the first sentence. However, the very fact that
these questions are governed by specific contractual provisions does not necessarily
mean that they have no relevance in the framework of a treaty claim. One cannot
seriously dispute that a State can discriminate against an investor by the manner in
which it concludes an investment contract and/or exercises the rights thereunder. Any
other interpretation would consider treaty and contract claims as mutually exclusive,
which would be at odds with the well-established principles deriving from the distinction

between treaty and contract claims as discussed above (see supra Nos. 148 et seq.).

Pakistan’s main contention in this respect is that Bayindir’s claim is “untenable”, in
particular because “[o]ther projects must be examined on their merits and in the light of
their factual and contractual context” (Reply J.. p. 71 4.96). Prima facie, this
argument may well apply to Bayindir’s contention that it was the only contractor
expelled when 29 out of 35 projects were delayed as a result of problems very similar to
those faced at M-1, (see in particular the projects listed in C-Mem. J., pp. 34-37.

et _seqg.), but not to the contract with PMC JV, which relates to the very same project
from which Bayindir was expelled. Indeed, and this is not disputed by Pakistan, PMC JV
was awarded the contract for the remaining works on the M-1 Project with a four year
(1460 days) completion deadline (Exh. [Bay.] CX 29).

Moreover, the memorandum of understanding between NHA and PMC JV provided that
the time of completion would be “agreed between the parties depending upon the
situation of NHA cashflow” (Exh. [Bay.] CX 132). The mere allegation that NHA’s
financial difficulties were due to the fact that it “has already paid up to date Bayindir

insofar as the works on the project, and has already paid to Bayindir the very, very

57

218.

ce.

219.

220.

221.

222.

substantial advance mobilisation payment” (Tr. J. 98:28-35) does not appear to explain
the difference in treatment with respect to the completion deadlines.

Failing an explanation or particular insight about the reasons for the extended timetable
agreed with PMC JV, Bayindir's allegation of discrimination with respect to the
construction schedules cannot be considered as untenable under the applicable prima
facie standard.

Selective tendering

Bayindir further contends that Pakistan did not follow a bid procedure to replace it for
the completion of the remaining works. Relying on several press reports, Bayindir
submits that it was only after the memorandum of understanding had been signed with
PMC JV that Pakistan organized a "selective tendering" (limited to two governmental
organizations) as a later stage “cover-up” (C-Mem. J.. p. 46. 159-160).

Again Pakistan does not contest that a selective tendering in favor of local contractors
could constitute a violation of the MFN clause. What Pakistan disputes is the alleged
irregularity of the process. In particular the parties disagree on the interpretation of the
NHA Minutes of Meeting of 13 November 2002, during which NHA's Vigilance Wing
stated:

PMC-JV was the Consortium which was constituted by concerned NHA officials
through negotiations with concerned firms mainly SKB and this aspect was
reported by us at that time. Now through the process of manipulation as reported
by insiders the contract is being awarded to the same.

(Ex. [Pak.] 70)

Pointing out that the Executive Board of NHA did not question the remarkable assertion
that PMC JV was actually "constituted by concerned NHA officials", Bayindir submits
that the wording "at that time" proves that Pakistan already intended to bring in the local
consortium led by SKB, prior to Bayindir's expulsion (Rejoinder J., p. 27. 87-88). At
the jurisdictional hearing, Pakistan strongly challenged Bayindir's reliance on “these
minutes to show that NHA had already organised a replacement consortium of local
contractors prior to Bayindir's expulsion from the site in April 2001” (Ir. J. 97:26-31).

It would be both premature and inappropriate for the Tribunal to express any views as
to the regularity of the tendering process on these (and other) materials. Whatever their

58

223.

224.

225.

226.

weight on the merits, it is clear that NHA informed the press immediately following the
expulsion of Bayindir that a local consortium would complete the works. Under these
circumstances, Bayindir’s allegations as to the openness of the tendering cannot be

deemed untenable for jurisdictional purposes.

The fact remains that, taken together, Bayindir’s allegations in respect of the selective
tender, and that the expulsion was due to Pakistan’s decision to favor a local contractor,
and that the local contractor was awarded longer completion time-limits, if proven, are

clearly capable of founding a MFN claim®.

As a final matter, and irrespective of the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal wishes
to emphasize that it is generally difficult to prove that an objectively different situation is
the result of unequal treatment rather than of the existence of reasons to treat the two
situations differently. At this preliminary stage this reinforces the Tribunal in its
conclusion that it has jurisdiction to hear Bayindir’s most favored nation claims on the
merits.

Bayindir’s fair and equitable treatment claim

In its RA, Bayindir asserted that “Pakistan failed to promote and protect Bayindir's
investment in violation of Article Il of the BIT [and] failed to ensure the fair and equitable
treatment of Bayindir's investment, in violation of Article Il (2) of the BIT (RA, p. 11
137). In summary, Bayindir’s fair and equitable treatment claim is based on Pakistan's
alleged “failure to provide a stable framework for Bayindir's investment” (C-Mem. J., pp.
41-43. 140 et seq.) and on the alleged fact that “Pakistan's expulsion of Bayindir was
unfair and inequitable” (C-Mem. J., pp. 43-47 150 et seq.).

Pakistan’s case is that there is no obligation of equitable treatment in the BIT and, even
if there were, there would be no violation of fair and equal treatment.

At the hearing Bayindir noted that “[i]t is an aggregation of matters which we say if not answered
form a basis for the Tribunal to make inferences” (Tr. J.. 150:19-21); “that is information to the
Tribunal which has not been denied and possibly when we get to the merits we can require
some document to establish that” (Tr. J., 156:12-15).

59

227.

228.

229.

230.

231.

Is there an obligation of equitable treatment?

In its objections to jurisdiction, Pakistan pointed out that Article Il (2) contains no
requirement of fair and equitable treatment:

Bayindir is presumably seeking to rely upon some form of argument based on
the most favoured nation provisions of Article II(2). If that is the case, then, first
one would have expected that argument to have been pleaded in the Request
and particulars given. Secondly, in the absence of such particulars, all that is
before the Tribunal is the reliance on a provision of the BIT which on its terms
plainly does not impose the duties invoked by Bayindir.

(Mem. J., p. 58, 1.4.53)

Bayindir expanded on the legal basis of the equitable treatment claim in its Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction:

The applicability of a fair and equitable treatment obligation to Bayindir's
investment arises out of both the BIT preamble and the most favored nation
clause.

(C-Mem. J., p. 38, 1129)

The preamble describes the objectives which Turkey and Pakistan pursued in entering
into the BIT as follows:

The Islamic Republic of Pakistan [...] and the Republic of Turkey [...] agre[e] that
fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a
stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic
resources.

Despite the use of the verb “agree”, it is doubtful that, in the absence of a specific
provision in the BIT itself, the sole text of the preamble constitutes a sufficient basis for
a self-standing fair and equitable treatment obligation under the BIT. It remains however
for the Tribunal to consider whether, through the most favoured nation clause contained
in Article 1I(2) of the BIT, Bayindir is entitled to rely on Pakistan’s obligation to act in a
fair and equitable manner contained in other BITs concluded by Pakistan. Article II(2) of
the BIT reads as follows:

Each Party shall accord to these investments, once established, treatment no
less favourable than that accorded in similar situations to investments of its
investors or to investments of investors of any third country, which ever is the
most favourable.

Neither in its Reply nor at the jurisdictional hearing, did Pakistan dispute Bayindir's
assertion that the investment treaties which Pakistan has concluded with France, the
Netherlands, China, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Switzerland contains an explicit
fair and equitable treatment clause (C-Mem. J., p. 38, 131-132).

60

233.

234.

235.

bb.

236.

237.

Under these circumstances and for the purposes of assessing jurisdiction, the Tribunal
considers, prima facie, that Pakistan is bound to treat investments of Turkish nationals

189

"fairly and equitably.

For the event that the Tribunal were to accept an obligation of fair and equitable
treatment, Pakistan disputed that it violated it (Reply J., p. 70, 14.94):

It was Bayindir's default under the Contract and not any alleged unfair or
inequitable treatment on the part of the Government of Pakistan which led to
Bayindir's withdrawal from the site.

(Reply J., p. 67, 14.81)

The fact that an act is, or may be, in accordance with the Contract would not in and of
itself rule out a treaty violation. The real question for present purposes is whether the
facts alleged by Bayindir are capable of constituting a violation of Pakistan's obligation
to treat Bayindir’s investment fairly and equitably.

Accordingly, the Tribunal will review Bayindir’s main allegation, namely that (i) Pakistan
failed to provide a stable framework for Bayindir’s investment and that (ii) Pakistan's
expulsion of Bayindir was unfair and inequitable.

Alleged failure to provide a stable framework for Bayindir’s investment

In summary, Bayindir alleges that NHA was highly unstable for reasons of “lack of
management continuity” as well as “malpractice and corruption” (C-Mem. J.. p. 41
143). More importantly, Bayindir contends that the government of Pakistan itself was
unstable during the project:

[E]ach time there was a change of government, Pakistan's attitude towards
Bayindir's investment changed, commencing with the initial contract in 1993, its
cancellation in 1994, the contract renewal in 1997, and finally the expulsion in
2001.

(C-Mem. J., p. 42, 1146)

The contents of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment were described in
Tecmed v. Mexico, to which both Parties refer (see, for instance, C-Mem. J., p. 39,

As to the general possibility to “import” a fair and equitable treatment provision contained in
another BIT, see, for instance Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada, Decision of 10 April
2001, 49] 111, 1145.

61

239.

240.

134; Tr. J. 101:20 et seq.)*°. Reasoning “in light of the good faith principle established
by international law’, the tribunal held that the concept of fair and equitable treatment
obliges the State:

[tlo provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic
expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the
investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent
manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the
foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and
regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant
policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its
investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions
conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or
requirements issued, or the resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the
goals underlying such regulations. The foreign investor also expects the host
State to act consistently, i.e., without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting
decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor to
assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and
business activities. The investor also expects the State to use the legal
instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment in
conformity with the function usually assigned to such instruments, and not to
deprive the investor of its investment without the required compensation.

Pakistan does not dispute that it has an obligation to maintain a stable framework for
investment, but it argues that governmental instability as such does not amount to a
breach of the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment (Ir. J., 102:9-21). The

 

Tribunal agrees thus far, and endorses Pakistan’s submission that “[a]n investor can

never have an expectation that governments or government personnel would not

  

change over the course of a given project” (Tr. J.. 103:6-8). However, Bayindir claims
that the changes in government had a direct influence upon Pakistan's conduct towards
Bayindir's investment, which is a question that should clearly be decided on the merits.

The Tribunal considers that, in the light of the above-quoted terms of the BIT’s
preamble and for purposes of establishing jurisdiction, it cannot prima facie be ruled out
that Pakistan’s fair and equitable treatment obligation comprises an obligation to
maintain a stable framework for investment.

It is true that Pakistan asserted that the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment
as expressed in Tecmed v. Mexico™' relates to “changes to the regulatory framework in

The Tribunal further notes that at the hearing this approach was implicitly endorsed also by
Pakistan when declaring: “What matters so far as fair and equitable treatment is concerned is
the actions of the government and whether there was an arbitrary refusal to grant a licence, or
an arbitrary revocation of an existing permit” (Ir. J., 103:4-7).

62

243.

which an investment has been made” and that “Bayindir can point to no equivalent
regulatory changes in this case and of course there are none” (Tr. J., 102:7-9).

 

However, the general definition of fair and equitable treatment in Tecmed refers not
only to “all rules and regulations that will govern [the] investments” but also to “the goals
of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives”®*. Hence, the fact that
in Tecmed the change concerned a failure to renew a necessary operating permit does
not rule out that a State can breach the ‘stability limb’ of its obligation through acts
which do not concern the regulatory framework but more generally the State’s policy
towards investments.

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that, if proven, Pakistan’s alleged
change in its general policy toward Bayindir’s investment is capable of constituting a
breach of Pakistan’s obligations to accord fair and equitable treatment.

The allegedly unfair and inequitable expulsion

Bayindir's “central allegation” (Rejoinder_J., p. 20, 62) concerning the fair and
equitable treatment claim is that the expulsion was motivated by “local favouritism” and
that the alleged delays in completion were merely a pretext (C-Mem. J., p. 47, J 164). In
this respect, Bayindir’s fair and equitable treatment claim coincides with its most
favoured nation claim. Hence, the Tribunal refers to the discussion above (see supra
Nos. 208 et seq.).

Besides the allegation of local favouritism, Bayindir contends that “[t]he circumstances
of Bayindir's expulsion and the awarding of the contract to Pakistani contractors further
indicates inequity and bad faith” (C-Mem. J., p. 45, 157) as the “actual motivation for
ending Bayindir’s employment [was] the World Bank’s strong opposition to the Project”
(Rejoinder J., p. 23, 173) and related “budgetary reasons” (Tr. J., 129:3-9):

[T]here is enough to show that these elements of government action for a pre-
determined result to get direct advantages both from the point of view we say of
World Bank inputs and coercion, direct results for the Republic of Pakistan so far
as saving money and its view of national interest is concerned. Real results for

results for its desire to establish local industry, real saving of over $100m on the
contract price at a later date, and an attempt which is still being actively pursued
to recover $104m of money from our guarantees that we will be responsible to
fund the roadway.

(Tr. J., 150:4-17)

In conjunction with the selective tender process discussed above, Bayindir further
suggests that “it is now public knowledge that the award of Bayindir's investment to the
Pakistani consortium was riddled with corruption” (C-Mem. J., p. 46, 9157).

Pakistan does not contest that the expulsion could amount to a violation of fair and
equitable treatment. It alleges, however, essentially that “any suggestion that Bayindir
was expelled from the site at gunpoint in implementation of some Pakistan political or
economic agenda is simply wrong” (Reply J., p. 68, | 4.84). More specifically, it insists
that (i) Bayindir’s allegations are largely based on press reports, (ii) Bayindir’s claim
presupposes corruption on the part of Pakistan — which cannot be readily inferred by an
international tribunal, and (iii) the delays were real and NHA had a right to expel

Bayindir (Tr. J., 106:32-107:10).

Whether Bayindir’s contested allegations are true or wrong, is a question for the merits.
At this stage, the only relevant issue is whether it cannot be ruled out, at least prima
facie, that the alleged unfair and inequitable expulsion is, if proven, capable of falling
within the Scope of Pakistan’s obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment.

With specific regard to the actual reasons for the alleged expulsion, Bayindir relies on
two letters of the World Bank recommending that the Project to be stopped (letter dated
26 May 2000, (Exh. [Bay.] CX 152); letter dated of 5 June 2000, (Exh. [Bay.] CX 153))
and on two notes of the Ministry of Communication and Railways (note dated 4
November 2000) (Exh. [Bay.] CX 127); note dated 2 April 2001, (Exh. [Bay.] CX 151).
The letters from the World Bank emphasized that the M1 Project was financially
unattractive and considered that stopping it appeared to be the most economic course
of action. The notes of the Ministry appear to show that, following these letters, the
financial status of the contract was addressed “at the highest level”.

At the outset of the hearing on jurisdiction, Pakistan pointed out that these documents
constitute “confidential and privileged legal materials which have apparently been taken
from the files of the Government of Pakistan” (Tr. J., 18:3-5) and reserved all its rights

 

64

249.

250.

251.

252.

in this regard (Tr. J., 17:21-24). Upon a specific request by Pakistan to clarify how these

 

documents were obtained, Bayindir explained that these document “turned up in the
files of the claimant being files removed on its expulsion from Pakistan” but had “no
further capacity to explain how they got there” (Tr. J., 38:29-33). Insisting on the fact

 

that the veracity of the documents was not at stake, Bayindir informed the Tribunal that
in the event Pakistan should formally challenge these documents, it would reply “by
making an application under rule 34.2 that the tribunal call upon the respondent to
produce these documents” (Tr. J., 39:16-19). As already mentioned, Pakistan did not

 

formally request the Tribunal to strike these documents from the record®®. Hence, the
Tribunal considers that the documents referred to in paragraph 247 above are part of
the record in this arbitration.

On this basis, the Tribunal considers that Bayindir’s claim does not appear prima facie
untenable.

Having considered that the allegedly unfair motives of expulsion, if proven, are capable
of founding a fair and equitable treatment claim under the BIT, the Tribunal concludes
that it has jurisdiction to hear Bayindir’s claims based on Pakistan's obligation to accord
fair and equitable treatment to foreign investment.

Hence, there is no need for the Tribunal to discuss Bayindir’s additional allegations of
corruption at this stage. In any event, it bears noting that the question would not be — as
erroneously suggested by Pakistan — whether the Tribunal is ready or not to infer
corruption and/or conspiracy in the decision to expel Bayindir and to replace it with a

 

local contractor (see Tr. J., 106:24-32). The question would simply be whether,
assuming that corruption and/or conspiracy were proven, this would fall within the

scope of the fair treatment guarantee.

As a final matter, the Tribunal notes that Bayindir’s “concerns about the independency
of the Pakistani judiciary” (Rejoinder J.. p. 24, 78) and “its lack of confidence in

receiving due process in Pakistan” (Rejoinder J., p. 25, 1 81) has become moot, insofar

Later during the jurisdictional hearing, Pakistan’s Counsel maintained the reservation over these
documents and added: “they are obviously before the tribunal for what they are worth and we
shall have to get instructions from the Government of Pakistan as to what our next steps should
be” (Tr. J. 39:7-11). To this date, the Tribunal did not receive any request regarding these
documents.

65

254.

as the possible pursuit of the Contract Claims in the Pakistani arbitration is concerned.
As to the allegation of lack of due process in respect of the Constitutional Petition (see
for instance (Rejoinder J., p. 25, 81), the Tribunal finds that Bayindir cannot infer a
breach of due process simply from NHA’s Chairman writing to the Minister of
Communication that “[oJur legal counsel will defend the case and get [a favourable
outcome] after appearing in Court” (Exh. [Bay.] CX 131). Moreover, as correctly pointed
out by Pakistan, a claim based on failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings must
take into account the system of justice as a whole, not only an individual decision in the
course of proceedings (Tr. 108:13-19 referring to Waste Management. v. Mexico™). In
the present case, there is no evidence whatsoever supporting, even on a prima facie
basis, Bayindir’s allegation that “the lack of independence of Pakistan's judiciary is

notorious” (Rejoinder J., p. 24. ] 77).
Bayindir’s expropriation claims

Article Ill (1) of the BIT states the following in connection with expropriation:

Investments shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subject, directly or
indirectly to measures of similar effects except for a public purpose, in a non-
discriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation, and in accordance with due process of law and the general
principles of treatment provided for in Article II of this Agreement.

Bayindir contends that the following actions of Pakistan constitute an expropriation
within the meaning of Article III (1) of the BIT:

(i) | Pakistan's expulsion of Bayindir from the site, enforced by armed units of the
Frontier Works Organization, was “a large-scale taking of Bayindir's Motorway
investment [including a right to payment for several months of Interim Payment
Certificates and works in progress], for the purpose of transferring property and
interests into government hands before being passed along to PMC N” (C-Mem.
J. pp. 49-50, 4173).

(ii) On the ground that Bayindir did not re-export equipment within the time limit set
by the applicable Pakistani regulation, Pakistan's Customs services encashed
bank guarantees issued by Standard Chartered Bank ("SCB") securing unpaid
import customs duties on behalf of Bayindir (Rejoinder J., pp. 30-31, 101-102).

66

255.

257.

258.

It is not disputed that expropriation is not limited to in rem rights and may extend to
contractual rights. More generally, the Tribunal considers that, in the absence of a
specific definition in the BIT, expropriation can take place also where the measure is not
technically a regulatory act. As it has been consistently held in investment cases,
expropriation may arise out of a simple interference by the host State in the investor's
rights with the effect of depriving the investor — totally or to a significant extent — of its
investment (RFCC v. Morocco, [supra Fn. 71], | 64)

Again, Pakistan’s main contention is that the alleged taking of the investment was a
mere contractual termination and that “there was no appropriation of rights or interests
by the Government of Pakistan” (Reply J., p. 75, 4.108). At the jurisdictional hearing,
Pakistan summarized its case as follows:
[I]n terms of the taking of contractual rights, a party which maintains that its
contractual partner has failed to perform its bargain and therefore purports to
exercise its power to repudiate a contract or to terminate it is doing what any
contractual party does. [...] It is not acting in a sovereign capacity at all. It is quite
different from something like the legislative abrogation of contractual rights which
one had in Iran in 1980, which one found, for example, with the Libyan legislation
abrogating concession contracts in the early 1970s.

(Tr. J., 78:12-24)

 

It is common ground, as the tribunal in /mpregilo explicitly held, “that only measures
taken by Pakistan in the exercise of its sovereign power (“puissance publique”), and not
decisions taken in the implementation or performance of the Contracts, may be

considered as measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation’®®.

True it is that the tribunal in /mpregilo considered that the claims based on ‘unforeseen
geological conditions’ did “not enter within the purview [of the expropriation clause of
the BIT]’ and declined jurisdiction in this regard®®. Geological conditions, let alone when
unforeseen, are — by their very nature — not attributable to an act of State. Thus, the
tribunal in Impregilo had no hesitation over excluding them from its jurisdiction®’. It is
clear that, in counsel for Pakistan’s words, this kind of claim “would fail at the

 

jurisdictional threshold” (Tr. J., 75:23-31).

The situation is very different where, as in this case, a party invokes an action by the
State, which may or may not have been taken in puissance publique. Unlike the case of
geological conditions, it is difficult to rule out puissance publique upon a prima facie
analysis at the jurisdictional stage. Significantly, the tribunal in /mpregilo asserted
jurisdiction over Impregilo’s other claims based on “alleged breaches of contract”
because it was not then in a position to decide whether or not these could be

98

considered as breaches of Article 5 of the BIT [i.e., expropriation]’™”. Similarly, the

tribunal in Siemens considered that “the issue whether the breach of the Contract may
or may not be an act of expropriation is a matter related to the merits of the dispute”®.
Indeed, Pakistan’s argument that “expropriation of contract rights [...] goes beyond the
exercise or purported exercise of contractual powers and capacities” relies on the

Waste Management case (Tr. J. 202:16-33), which was an award on the merits'®°.

 

In the present case, and without in any manner prejudging its eventual determination of
the relevant facts, the Tribunal cannot rule out that there may have been a sufficient
involvement by the State in the alleged taking of Bayindir’s investment so as to amount
to an expropriation under the BIT.

The Tribunal is reinforced in this conclusion by the unchallenged fact that Bayindir's
equipment was retained on site following the expulsion. In the Tribunal’s understanding,

Impregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74], {| 284. The tribunal concluded this passage noting that
“only after a careful examination of those alleged breaches will the Tribunal be able to determine
whether the behaviour of Pakistan went beyond that which an ordinary Contracting party could
have adopted”.

Siemens v. Argentine [supra Fn. 80], J] 182.

Waste Management. v. Mexico [supra Fn. 94], | 174; in the relevant section the tribunal was
dealing with the question “Was there conduct tantamount to an expropriation of Acaverde’s
contractual rights?”. This Tribunal observes that this question was not dealt with in the Decision
on Jurisdiction (see Waste Management, Inc. v. Mexico |CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/2,
Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 June 2000; available at
http:/www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/WasteMgmt-Mexico-2-Jurisdiction-26Jun2002.pdf).
For the sake of completeness, it is useful to observe that at the jurisdictional stage the tribunal
held that “it is clear that one and the same measure may give rise to different types of claims in
different courts or tribunals. Therefore, something that under Mexican legislation would
constitute a series of breaches of contract expressed as non-payment of certain invoices,
violation of exclusivity clauses in a concession agreement, etc., could, under the NAFTA, be
interpreted as a lack of fair and equitable treatment of a foreign investment by a government
(Article 1105 of NAFTA) or as measures constituting “expropriation” under Article 1110 of the
NAFTA. In any case, it is not the mission of the Tribunal, at this stage of the proceedings, to
make an in-depth analysis of alleged breaches of the NAFTA invoked by the Claimant, since that
task, should it become necessary, belongs to an analysis of the merits of the question” (ibid.,
127/(a)).

Bayindir’s claim for taking of its investment includes the retention of the equipment.
Pakistan objects that this retention was provided for in the Contract (Reply J., pp. 69-
70. 487-491), including a mechanism for compensating Bayindir for the equipment:

Any issue relating to amounts due to Bayindir for the value of such equipment, if
any, shall be calculated and paid after the completion of the project in
accordance with Clause 63.3 of the Conditions of Contract.

(Reply J., p. 70, 14.91)

Here again, this argument neglects the principle of the possible coincidence of treaty
and contract claims. Moreover, in the Tribunal’s view, such a payment may qualify as
“compensation” within the meaning of Article Ill of the BIT. Whether such compensation
would be “prompt, adequate, and effective”, which may render an expropriation of the

equipment lawful under the BIT, is a question for the merits.

Conclusion

For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over the Treaty
Claims raised in these proceedings. The Tribunal emphasizes that this decision is not
equivalent to joining the question of jurisdiction to the merits as contemplated by Rule
41(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules'*'. Rather, it holds that Bayindir’s claims are
capable of constituting a violation of the BIT. As it emphasized on several occasions,
the threshold at the jurisdictional level, which implies a prima facie standard, is different
from the standards which the Claimant will have to discharge on the merits to show an
actual treaty breach.

SHOULD THE TRIBUNAL STAY THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS?

Pakistan finally asserts that even if quod non the Tribunal would have jurisdiction to
determine the Treaty Claims, because of their intrinsic contractual nature, the current
proceedings for breach of treaty should be stayed until the arbitral tribunal provided in

the Contract has determined the contractual issues.

This approach has been adopted in the much-debated SGS v. Philippines case. Faced
with the situation where the Philippines’ responsibility under the BIT — a matter which

From this point of view, the Tribunal cannot share the approach adopted by the tribunal in
Impregilo v. Pakistan [supra No. 74], J] 285.

did fall within its jurisdiction — was subject to "the factual predicate of a determination”
by the Regional Trial Court of the total amount owing by the respondent, the tribunal
held that:

[t]hat being so, justice would be best served if the Tribunal were to stay the
present proceedings pending determination of the amount payable, either by
agreement between the parties or by the Philippine courts in accordance with
Article 12 of the CISS Agreement.‘

The view that an ICSID tribunal has the power to stay proceedings pending the
determination, by some other competent forum, of an issue relevant to its own decision,
explicit in SGS v. Philippines, is also present, though impliedly, in the discussion in SGS
v. Pakistan’. The Tribunal agrees with Pakistan’s view that this “course of action [...]
would not involve a refusal to exercise jurisdiction (of the kind condemned by the ad
hoc committee in the Vivendi Annulment decision)” (Reply J., p. 23, 1 2.49; see also Tr.

 

Pakistan recognizes that its position was rejected by the tribunal in Impregilo (Reply J.
rs} 2.50) where, “drawing upon the approach that was adopted in SGS v.

Philippines'™, Pakistan submit[ed] that th[at] Tribunal should stay these proceedings, in

order to allow the contractual dispute resolution mechanisms to take their course” ‘>.

In Impregilo, the tribunal held, inter alia, that:

[wJhilst arguably justified in some situations, a stay of proceedings would be
inappropriate here, for a number of reasons. Firstly, such a stay if anything,
would confuse the essential distinction between the Treaty Claims and the
Contract Claims as set out above. Since the two enquiries are fundamentally
different (albeit with some overlap), it is not obvious that the contractual dispute
resolution mechanisms in a case of this sort will be undermined in any
substantial sense by the determination of separate and distinct Treaty Claims.
Indeed, this is all the more so in a case such as the present, where (unlike SGS
v. Philippines) the parties to these proceedings (Impregilo and Pakistan) are
different from the parties to the contract arbitration proceedings (GBC and
WAPDA).

Further, if a stay was ordered, as Pakistan has sought, it is unclear for how long
this should be maintained; what precise events might trigger its cessation; and
what attitude this Tribunal ought then to take on a resumed hearing to any
proceedings or findings that may have occurred in the interim in Lahore. '°°

According to Pakistan, on the facts of the present case, there are compelling reasons
for departing from the solution adopted by /mpregilo. This allegedly “follows both from
considerations of logic and a practical concern for the orderly settlement of disputes”
(Reply J., p. 22 2.48). As to the latter, Pakistan contends that the (contractual)
arbitral tribunal sitting in Pakistan is already seized of the dispute between NHA and
Bayindir and that (subject to a stay in these ICSID proceedings and to the latter
tribunal's own decision on Bayindir's challenge to jurisdiction), it is obliged to proceed to
the merits, regardless of extraneous factors.

In the Tribunal’s view its jurisdiction under the BIT allows it — if this should prove
necessary — to resolve any underlying contract issue as a preliminary question. Exactly
like the arbitral tribunal sitting in Pakistan, this Tribunal should proceed with the merits
of the case. This is an inevitable consequence of the principle of the distinct nature of
treaty and contract claims. The Tribunal is aware that this system implies an intrinsic
risk of contradictory decisions or double recovery. In this respect, in Camuzzi v.
Argentina — a case where it was explicitly held that “the claim was [...] founded on both
the contract and the Treaty” — the tribunal noted that “this is an issue belonging to the
merits of the dispute” and for which “international law and decisions offer numerous

mechanisms for preventing the possibility of double recovery” "””.

In any event, accepting that it has discretion to order the stay of the present
proceedings as requested by Pakistan, that discretion is to be exercised only if there
are truly compelling reasons. In the present case, the Tribunal cannot see any
compelling reason to stay the current arbitration.

The Tribunal is sympathetic towards the efforts of the tribunal in SGS v. Philippines “to
give effect to the parties’ contracts while respecting the general language of BIT dispute

settlement provisions”'™.

However, to do so raises several practical difficulties. In
particular, it may be very difficult to decide, at this preliminary stage, which contractual

issues (if any) will have to be addressed by the Tribunal on the merits.

Moreover, as a leading commentator recently put it, in practice the decision to stay the
ICSID proceedings “results in the BIT tribunal having jurisdiction over an empty shell

and depriving the BIT dispute resolution of any meaning”'®.

Costs

In its Counter-Memorial, Bayindir made the following submission with respect to costs:

Before both the courts in Pakistan and Turkey, the GOP has sought to benefit
from the fact that Bayindir had seized ICSID, without revealing that it would be
resisting ICSID's jurisdiction regarding Bayindir's claims. Under the
circumstances, it would seem unfair that Bayindir should bear the costs of this
first part of the proceedings. While Bayindir accepts that the Tribunal may wish
to reserve its decision on costs until the Final Award, it submits that the costs for
the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration should be borne by Pakistan.

(C-Mem. J. p. 89 1314)

In a letter of its counsel dated 16 August 2005, Pakistan drew the Tribunal’s attention to
the waste of costs due to Bayindir’s late abandonment of its Contract Claims and
requested the following relief:

[D]eal with the issues of principle and apportionment relating to costs in its
award/decision, including the wasted costs due to Bayindir’s late change in
position, and to award the Government of Pakistan its costs and expenses
incurred as a result of these proceedings.

At the jurisdictional hearing (Tr. J.. 13:2-4), Pakistan noted that Bayindir’s decision to
abandon its Contract Claims in this arbitration after a double exchange of written
submissions, has engendered a substantial waste of costs. It also submitted that a
significant amount of preparation work in view of the jurisdictional hearing became
redundant, not only for Pakistan but also for the members of the Tribunal.

When invited to respond, Bayindir submitted that “the issue of costs should be a matter
for submission after the award on objections to jurisdiction” (letter of counsel dated 26
August 2005).

At this stage, the Tribunal takes due note of the parties’ positions and requests with
respect to costs. It decides, however, to deal with costs at the merits stage, which will
allow it to make an overall assessment of costs. It will then also take into account the

consequences of Bayindir's initial choice to raise both Treaty and Contract Claims and
of its late decision to abandon the Contract Claims.

DECISION ON JURISDICTION

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal makes the following decision:

a) The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this
arbitration. .

b) The Tribunal denies Respondent's application to suspend these proceedings.

c) The Tribunal will, accordingly, make the necessary order for the continuation of the

proceedings on the merits.
d) The decision on costs is deferred to the second phase of the arbitration on the

merits.
