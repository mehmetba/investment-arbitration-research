I. INTRODUCTION

1. This

 

e concerns a dispute submitted to ICSID pursuant to the Agreement between
the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of Romania on the Mutual
Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 14 March 1995
(“BIT”),! and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID Convention”). The BIT was agreed in the
Italian, Romanian and English languages with all three texts being equally authentic,
and in case of any differences of interpretation, the English text was to be considered
as the text of reference. The ICSID Convention was agreed in the English, French and
Spanish languages. For ease of reference, given also the language of this arbitration,

the English texts of the BIT and the ICSID Convention are cited below.
Il. THE PARTIES
2. The two Claimants are:
a) Mr. Marco Gavazzi, an Italian national, residing at Via Appiani 1, 22036 Erba

(Como), Italy; and

b) Mr. Stefano Gavazzi, an Italian national, residing at Via Madonna del Bosco 12,

23807 Merate (Lecco), Italy
hereinafter, collectively “the Claimants” or “Gavazzi.”

The Claimants are represented in the present proceedings by Prof. Avv. Giorgio

Sacerdoti and Dr. Avv. Anna De Luca, Via Privata Maria Teresa 4, 20123 Milan, Italy.

3, The Respondent is the Romanian State, acting by the Authority for State Assets
Administration, headquartered in Bucharest, Romania, 50 Cpt A. Serbanescu St.

(hereinafter “the Respondent” or “Romania”).

1 Agreement between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of Romania on the Mutual
Promotion and Protection of Investments, entered into force 14 March 1995 and terminated on 14 March
2010, subject to the ‘sunset provision’ in Article 11(3) (C-4).

The Respondent is represented in the present proceedings by a consortium consisting
of SCA Cobuz & Associates, SPRL Bostina & Associates and Manuela Sarbu Law

Office, with an address at Str. General Berthelot 59, Bucharest, Romania.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 2 August 2012, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 23 July 2012,
together with exhibits C-1 through C-45 (the “Request”).

On 27 August 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to
proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule
7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration

Proceedings.

By letter of 5 September 2012, the Claimants proposed a method of constituting the
Tribunal pursuant to Rule 2(1)(a) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration
Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”). By the same letter, the Claimants appointed
Mr. V. V. Veeder QC, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator.

On 9 October 2012, the Respondent accepted the Claimants’ proposed method of
constituting the Tribunal. Pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the
Parties thus agreed that the Tribunal consist of three arbitrators, with each party
appointing an arbitrator, and the presiding arbitrator to be appointed by the co-
arbitrators in consultation with the Parties. The Parties’ method entailed the selection,
by the co-arbitrators, of three qualified candidates, which the Parties would rank in
order of preference. The co-arbitrators would then appoint one of the three candidates

as President of the Tribunal.

By the same letter dated 9 October 2012, the Respondent notified the Centre that it

appointed Mr. Mauro Rubino-Sammartano, a national of Italy, as arbitrator.

On the same day, the Centre called the Parties’ attention to Article 39 of the ICSID
Convention which provides that the majority of the arbitrators shall be nationals of

States other than the Contracting State party to the dispute (Romania) and the

6

Contracting State whose national is a party to the dispute (Italy), unless each individual
member of the Tribunal has been appointed by agreement of the Parties. In accordance
with Article 39, the Centre invited the Claimants to indicate whether they agreed to

the Respondent’s appointment.

On 11 October 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Veeder had accepted his

appointment as arbitrator.

On 17 October 2012, the Claimants informed the Centre that they had no objections

to the appointment by Romania of Mr. Rubino-Sammartano.

On 19 October 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Rubino-Sammartano had
accepted his appointment as arbitrator. On the same day, the Centre asked the co-
arbitrators to provide ICSID with a list of three candidates to serve as President, for

transmission to the Parties.

On 26 October 2012, the Centre transmitted a message from the co-arbitrators to the
Parties, requesting additional information on the qualifications of the potential
candidates for President of the Tribunal. The Parties responded by letters of 29
October and 2 November 2012.

On 6 November 2012, the Centre transmitted a message to the Parties with three
candidates proposed by the co-arbitrators and invited them to rank the candidates in

order of preference.

On 20 November 2012, the Centre informed the Parties that the co-arbitrators intended
to appoint Professor Hans van Houtte, a national of Belgium, as presiding arbitrator.
By letters of 20 and 26 November 2012, the Parties confirmed that they had no

objections to the appointment of Prof. van Houtte.

On 26 November 2012, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of
the ICSID Convention and Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that
all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The Secretary-General also
informed the Parties that Ms. Martina Polasek, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID,

would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.

The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 19 February 2013 in Paris, France.
The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed.
Among other things, Procedural Order No. | reflected the Parties’ agreement that the
proceeding would be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of 2006 and
that the place of the proceeding would be Paris, France. It also set out a timetable for
the filing of the Parties’ written submissions, with two alternative calendars, in the
event that the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the phase on jurisdiction from the merits.
It was decided at the first session that the Claimants’ Request was accepted as the

Claimants’ memorial on the merits, excluding quantum.

On 15 July 2013, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Claimants filed their
submission on quantum, accompanied by exhibits C-46 through C-58 and an expert
report of Deloitte. On the same day, the Respondent filed its objections to jurisdiction,
a counter-memorial on liability and a counterclaim, accompanied by exhibits R-1

through R-56.

On 31 July 2013, the Claimants filed a reply to the Respondent’s objections to

jurisdiction and counterclaim.

On 23 August 2013, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent filed
its request for bifurcation. The request reiterated the preliminary objections that were
raised in the Respondent’s submission of 15 July 2013, and requested that the Tribunal
order the suspension of the proceedings on the merits, pending the resolution of its

preliminary objections.
On 9 September 2013, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties

concerning the Respondent’s request for bifurcation of the proceedings.

On 13 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 deciding to join
the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and the Claimants’ objections to the
counterclaim to issues of liability, and to bifurcate issues of quantum to a further stage

of the proceeding. By the same order, the Tribunal adopted a new procedural calendar.

On 17 December 2013, the Claimants filed a reply on liability and a counter-memorial

 

on jurisdiction and admissibility of the counterclaim, accompanied by exhibits C-59

through C-70, the witness statements of Mr. Marco Gavazzi, Mr. Stefano Gavazzi,

Mr. Michele Mugnai, Mr. Florin Frumosu. Mr. Raimondo di Carpegna Varini, and

Mr. Betto Stendardi and the expert opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu.

On 11 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the

procedural calendar.

On 14 April 2014, the Respondent filed a rejoinder on liability and a reply on

jurisdiction and the counterclaim, accompanied by exhibits R-57 through R-146.

On 14 May 2014, the Claimants filed a rejoinder on jurisdiction and the counterclaim,
accompanied by exhibits C-71 through C-77 and the second expert opinion of

Professor Sergiu Deleanu.

On 22 May 2014, the Respondent sought leave from the Tribunal to file new evidence
in the form of a witness statement and an expert opinion. On 23 May 2014, the
Claimants objected to the admissibility of the Respondent’s proposed new evidence.
By the same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to produce the new evidence
and the Claimants to provide their comments on its admissibility. The Tribunal also
notified the Parties that it would consider the material de bene esse, for the purposes

of determining the admissibility of the Respondent’s evidence.

On 27 May 2014, the Respondent filed a witness statement of Ms. Viorica Tataru and
an expert opinion of Prof. Bazil Oglinda. By letter of 28 May 2014, the Claimants
filed their objections to the admissibility of the Respondent’s new evidence. By
communication of 29 May 2014, the Respondent submitted its rebuttal to the

Claimants’ objections of 28 May 2014.

On | June 2014, the Tribunal deliberated on the admissibility of the new witness
statement and expert report and, the following day, at the opening of the hearing,
informed the Parties that it decided to admit this new evidence into the record, subject

to the Claimants’ right to make any consequential application.

A hearing on jurisdiction and liability took place in Paris, France, on 2-5 June 2014.
In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present

at the hearing were:

At the hearing, on 2 June 2014, the Tribunal learnt that there were new exhibits
attached to Mrs. Tataru’s witness statement. On the same date, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the admissibility of the Respondent’s new
evidence. The Tribunal confirmed its decision to admit Mrs. Tataru’s statement and
Professor Oglinda’s expert opinion into the record, but denied the Respondent’s
request to admit the new exhibits attached to the witness statement. The Parties agreed

that the Claimants would cross-examine the new witness and expert, that Messrs.

 

Gavazzi could be present during the examination of Mrs. Tataru, and that either of
them could be called back for further testimony following her examination, to rebut
any new evidence. The Claimants, ultimately, did not avail themselves of this

opportunity.

On 5 June 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 with post-hearing

directions.

The Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 9 July 2014, and simultaneous

reply post-hearing briefs on 23 July 2014.

The Claimants filed their statement of costs on 31 August 2014 and the Respondent

filed its statement of costs on 19 September 2014.

FACTS AND CONTENTIONS

The dispute before the Tribunal arose against the backdrop of the end of the
Communist regime, when, in its transition toward a free-market economy during the

early 1990s, Romania started to privatize large State-owned enterprises.

The Romanian Government had created the State Ownership Fund (“SOF”), a
government entity with legal personality, to negotiate privatization agreements with
investors.” SOF was dissolved and replaced in 2000 by the Authority for Privatization

and Management of State Ownership (“APAPS”), which took over the

Ventures, Inc. v. Romania (ICSID Case No. ARB/O1/11), Award, para. 5 (12 Oct. 2005).

responsibilities, assets, and personnel of SOF.’ In 2004, through the merger of APAPS
with another State institution, the Government of Romania established the Authority
for State Assets Recovery (“AVAS”).‘ As of 22 December 2012, AVAS changed its

name into Authority for State Assets Administration (“AAAS”).>

AVAS, its predecessors, and its succ

 

ssor were all Romanian government agencies
tasked, among other things, with managing the privatization of State-owned

enterprises.° The dispute follows from the privatization of S.C. Socomet S.A.

 

(“Socomet” or “the Company”), a large steel company based in Northern Romania.
Socomet’s history dates back to 1796, when a metallurgical plant was established in
Ferdinandsberg (now Otelu Rosu). Over the next two centuries, the enterprise
underwent several changes of ownership and name. In 1948, the enterprise was
nationalized by the Romanian Government and renamed “Otelu Rosu” (Red Steel).
After the end of the Communist regime, the enterprise was transformed into a joint-
stock company, named “S.C. Socomet S.A.” On 21 April 2000, Socomet was renamed

“Gavazzi Steel S.A.”

At the time of its privatization, Socomet, like many companies that had been owned
and controlled by the State for many decades, also carried a very significant amount

of debt to Romanian government entities and needed substantial investment.

SOF wanted to privatize Socomet by selling its majority shareholding in the company,

which amounted to 70 percent of its shares. On 22 September 1998, it issued the

 

“Tender Book Regarding the Offer for Sale of Shares Managed by the State Ownership
Fund for the Trading Company Socomet S.A. Otelu Rosu by Direct Negotiation”
(‘Tender Book”),’ to provide prospective investors with information about the

financial and industrial conditions of Socomet.

Participation Administration, No. 296/2000).

The Claimants, Messrs. Marco and Stefano Gavazzi (who are brothers), were
interested in acquiring the offered 70 percent shareholding from SOF in Socomet and

engaged in negotiations with SOF on the basis of the Tender Book.*
A. The Share Purchase Contract

On 19 April 1999, SOF, on the one hand, and the Claimants, on the other, signed a
“Contract for Selling-Buying Shares No. 145” (“Share Purchase Contract” or
“Contract”).” Under the Contract, the Claimants undertook to purchase, and SOF
undertook to sell, 4,522,197 shares in Socomet, representing 70 percent of Socomet’s
registered capital, for the total price of USD 517,020. The Contract was made in the
English and Romanian languages, with the latter text prevailing over the former. For
convenience, given also the language of this arbitration, references below are made to
the English text (the Tribunal is not aware of any material discrepancy between the
English and Romanian texts). Under Article 14, the Contract was governed by

Romanian law.

In Article 5.1 of the Contract, the Claimants undertook to pay the purchase price in

two installments as follows:

(b) ...Within 48 banking hours from the date of fulfilling all the obligations
specified in Art. 10.1, the Buyer shall pay 297,184 USD to the Seller’s
account...

(c) Within 48 banking hours from the date of fulfilling all the obligations
foreseen in Art.10.1, the Buyer shall issue an Irrevocable Letter of Credit
for the balance of price amounting to 219,836 USD, that will be valid for
90 days from the Signing Date, to the Seller’s account... .'°

The Claimants also undertook, in Article 8.10.1 of the Contract, to make investments

and capital contributions in Socomet in the following terms:

period of maximum 5 (five) years starting with the Payment Date,

of 20,000,000 USD (out of which the environmental investments
represent 480,000 USD), scheduled according to Annex No.6. u

46, This Article 8.10.1(a) was amended by the Addendum of 7 July 2000 as follows:

47.

“Investment objectives”: “Oxygen Factory,” “Cooling water station Constructions,”
“Transformation post.”!> It further specified that USD 4,000,000 would have to be
invested during the period 24 June 2001-23 June 2002 with the following “Investment

objectives”: “Stoves and accessories.

specified payment date, which conditions were set out in Article 10 of the Contract in

Purchaser undertakes to bring in the company out of his own sources,
brought on its name, or by a third party brought by the purchaser, for a period
of maximum 5 (five) years, commencing on 24.06.2000, investments/capital
contributions, in the forms provided by law, in a total amount of 20,000,000
USS ... scheduled in compliance with Annex no. 6.'”

Annex No. 6, as modified by the Addendum, specified that USD 2,000,000 would
have to be invested during the period 24 June 2000-23 June 2001 with the following

old

SOF, for its part, was to satisfy a number of conditions prior to the contractually

the following terms:

Article 10 CONDITIONS TO BE MET PRIOR TO PAYMENT DATE

10.1 Whether [sic: If] within 40 days from the Signing Date, Seller does not

complete and settle the matters showed below, and/or whether [sic: if]
the Company shall be closed due to the lack of any of the authorizations
specified in Annex No.1/I/, the Buyer can decide to terminate de jure
the Contract, and by informing the Seller on this decision in 5 days from
the expiring of 40 days period, when this Contract will become null and
void.

The Balance Sheet on 31.12.1998 is drawn up by the Company
Management, and it is approved by the General Assembly of

Id. Art. 8.10.1(a) (C-19) (emphasis omitted). In an Addendum No. 2 to the Share Purchase Contract, the
parties agreed that the five-year period within which the Claimants were to make the investments and/or
contributions would start to run on 24 June 2000 (“Addendum no. 2/07.07.2000 to Share Sale Purchase

Contract No. 145/19.04.1999 — SC Gavazzi Steel SA Otelu Rosu,” Art. 1 (C-20)).

b. The Company debts to State Budget, Budget for Social Assurances,
Health Budget, including credits got from the Ministry of Finances for
paying the power and natural gas supply shall be rescheduled within 5
years, with a 2 years grace period, and all related penalties and
additional payment for delay shall be cancelled.

c. Seller shall exert all diligence required, and he shall support Buyer in
solving the rescheduling of outstanding debts, and for cancelling the
penalties and additional payments for delay owed by the Company to
CONEL and ROMGAZ.

10.

i

Seller shall inform at once the Buyer on the fulfillment of each of the
conditions specified in Art. 10.1.

10.3 Whether one or more of the conditions mentioned above will not be met
within the time provided in Art. 10.1., then Seller cannot require to the
Buyer to make the payment of the purchase price, unless Buyer will
make Disclaimer of Fulfilling Conditions.

10.4 In case the Contract will be terminated under the conditions specified
in Art. 10.1., Seller shall retur[n] at once to Buyer the bank guarantee.'*

49. Thus, under Article 10.1(b) of the Share Purchase Contract, the SOF was to bring

about — “complete and settle”!®

—the rescheduling of the Company’s debts to a number
of State entities and the cancellation of all related delayed payment penalties that had
been imposed on the Company (“Restructuring of the Company’s Debt”). Under
Article 10 of the Contract, the SOF’s failure to fulfill this condition, as well as any of
the other conditions listed in Article 10.1 of the Contract, within forty days of the
signing of the Contract, entitled the Claimants to terminate the Contract and relieved
them of their obligation to pay the purchase price. If the Claimants elected to terminate

the Contract, the Contract would “become null and void.”

50. The Respondent contends that, under Article 10.1(b)-(c) of the Share Purchase
Contract, SOF was obligated “to carry out legal proceedings, as per the applicable
framework,” such that Socomet would “obtain” the Restructuring of the Company’s

Debt, and to assist the Claimants in their endeavors to obtain the restructuring of

Socomet’s debts to its energy and gas suppliers, CONEL S.A. and ROMGAZ S.A.'7
In other words, according to the Respondent, SOF undertook merely to facilitate, and
not to grant, the Restructuring of the Company’s Debt — indeed, so the Respondent
contends, under Romanian law SOF had no authority to grant any exemptions from

payment of debts due to the State Budget.'*

Socomet was heavily indebted to the State and a multitude of State special funds and
State-owned enterprises. !? The Claimants assert that the success of Socomet’s
privatization as well as of the Claimants’ investment depended essentially on the
Restructuring of the Company’s Debt, which was fundamental for Socomet’s
revitalization and for the re-launch of its activities worldwide.”° For those reasons, the
Claimants assert, the restructuring of the Company’s debts, listed in Article 10 of the
Share Purchase Contract and specifically included in the Contract at the Claimants’

request, were of paramount importance to them.”!
B. SOF’s Notice of 3 June 1999 to the Claimants

On 3 June 1999, some 45 days after the signing of the Share Purchase Contract and
five days after the date the Claimants could still terminate the Contract pursuant to its
Article 10, SOF informed the Claimants by Notice No. 1/4026 that it had fulfilled the
conditions imposed by Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract and, importantly,
that the Romanian Prime Minister had approved the restructuring of the Company’s
debts to the State Budget, the Social Insurance Budget, the Health Budget and Special
Funds, as well as the cancellation of all related penalties and late payment additions.
Thus, SOF requested that the Claimants pay the contractually stipulated price for their

70 percent shareholding in Socomet. Specifically, the 3 June 1999 Notice stated:

In respect of the Stock Sale-Purchase Agreement no. 145/19.04.1999, we
notify the following:

1. By the letter no. P/2339/28.04.1999 (a copy enclosed hereto), the State
Property Fund [SOF] requested and the Prime Minister of Romania
approved the rescheduling of the debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu

Rosu to the State Budget, Social Insurance Budget, Health Budget and
Special Funds, as well as the annulment of all related penalties and late
payment additions.

2. By the letter no. P/2994/28.05.1999 (a copy enclosed hereto), the State
Property Fund [SOF] took all the necessary measures, by requesting
the Minister of Industry and Commerce the rescheduling of the past due
debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu to CONEL and ROMGAZ, as
well as the annulment of all related penalties and late payment
additions.

By these, the State Property Fund [SOF] has fulfilled the conditions resting
with it according to art. 10.1 of the Agreement, and Messrs. Marco and
Stefano Gavazzi shall subsequently pay the amount of USD 297,184 by
banking swift and issue an irrevocable letter of credit for the price difference,
amounting to USD 219,836, according to art. 5.1. letters (a) and (b) of the
Agreement.”
Two documents were enclosed with the 3 June 1999 Notice, namely: (i) Note No.
5/3228 dated 17 May 1999, signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of SOF,
the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Labor and Social Protection, and the Minister
of Health and approved by the then Prime Minister of Romania, Mr. Radu Vasile
(“Government’s Note No. 5/3228”); and (ii) Note No. P/2994 dated 28 May 1999,
addressed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of SOF to the then Romanian
Minister of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Radu Berceanu (“SOF’s Note No.

P/2994”).”4 These two Notes are described in the following paragraphs.

a) The Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999
The Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, which was entitled “Note on the
proposals to reschedule the debts and exempt from the payment of penalties and delay

penalties of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu,” stated in relevant part:

The STATE OWNERSHIP FUND signed Sale-Purchase Agreement no.
145/19.04.1999, for the stock of 70% of the shares of S.C. SOCOMET S.A.
Otelu Rosu, together with Mr. MARCO and Mr. STEFANO GAVAZZI, Italian
individuals, the latter being the only ones to submit a bid.

Considering the difficult economic and financial situation of S.C. SOCOMET
S.A. Otelu Rosu, the Purchasers are requesting, based on Government
Ordinance no. 11/1996 on the enforcement of budget debts and Government
Decision no. 55/1998 on privatizing companies, to benefit from the facilities
that may be granted with regard to rescheduling overdue and unpaid debts,
as well as exemption from the payment of related penalties and delay
penalties.

The request of MARCO and STEFANO GAVAZZI refers to rescheduling the
debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu that are overdue and unpaid on time
to the State Budget, the Social Insurance Budget, the Health Budget and
Special Funds, over a period of 5 years, with a grace period of 2 years.
Subsequently, the payments shall be done as follows: 10% in the third year,
30% in the fourth year and 60% in the last year, as well as the cancellation
of all related penalties and/or delay penalties.

The following is mentioned:

- MARCO and STEFANO GAVAZZI are the sole investors to submit a bid
for S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu. If the proposals for rescheduling the
debts and exempt from the payment of penalties and delay penalties of S.C.
SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu are approved, these investors also intend to
purchase the stock of shares held by the State Ownership Fund in S.C.
LAMDRO S.A. Turnu Severin;

- the requests are conditions for the payment of the price in the sale-purchase
agreement for the stock of shares managed by the State Ownership Fund in
S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu, but these requests exceed the competence
of the State Ownership Fund;

- the bidder undertakes to perform important investments in the company,
including those for environmental protection, in amount of USD 20 million,
investments that the latter will perform over a period of 5 years, for the
purpose of economically and financially readjusting and re-launching the
production activity.

We also mention that the sale-purchase agreement has a clause that provides
that if within 40 days as of the signing date the Seller does not finalize or
settle the rescheduling of debts and cancellation of related penalties, the
Purchaser may decide to terminate the Agreement de jure, informing the
Seller of this decision within 5 days from the expiry of the 40-day period, and
the Agreement shall become null and void.

If the Shares Sale-Purchase Agreement is unilaterally terminated by the
Purchaser (by waiver), by the State Ownership Fund (due to the Purchaser’s
failure to pay the financial obligations stipulated in the agreement clauses, in
the amount and within the provided deadlines) or for any other reason,
including force majeure, the payment benefits provided in this NOTE lose
their validity.

The exact amount of the debts, penalties and delay penalties, as well as their
distribution shall be verified by DGFPCFS Caras Severin.

Considering the above, please approve the facilities regarding the payment
of the said obligations of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu.”>
55. In the top right-hand part of the document, the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 bears
the printed notation “Approved — Prime Minister Radu Vasile,” as well as the Prime
Minister’s official stamp and his signature over the printed notation.*° As will be
discussed in detail further in this Decision, the Claimants and the Respondent disagree
on the nature and effect of Government Note No. 5/3228. For the Claimants, by this
Note, the Romanian Government expressly approved the rescheduling and waivers
provided by the Share Purchase Contract as a condition for the project. For the
Respondent, the Note was merely an internal communication from the Prime Minister
to various addressees requesting the approval of the proposed rescheduling, subject to

the observance of applicable legal provisions.

b) SOF’s Note No. P/2994 of 28 May 1999 to the Romanian Minister of Industry
and Commerce

56. SOF’s Note No. P/2994 of 28 May 1999 to the Romanian Minister of Industry and
Commerce tracks, by and large, the language of the Government’s Note No. 5/3228
of 17 May 1999. It also explicitly confirms that “the approval of the Prime Minister
of Romania on the rescheduling of the debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu ha[d]
been obtained, as well as the annulment of all related penalties and late payment
additions to the State Budget, Social Security Budget, Health Budget and Special
Funds.”? The Note goes on to request that the Minister of Industry and Commerce
approve the restructuring of Socomet’s debts to the National Electricity Company
CONEL S.A. and the National Company ROMGAZ S.A. for the purchase of
electricity, gas and petrol.?* In an appendix to the Note, SOF proposed that Socomet’s
debts to those two State-controlled entities be restructured as follows: (i) with respect
to CONEL S.A., rescheduling over five years the debts existing on 28 February 1999,

with a grace period of two years, and cancellation of the related penalties and delayed

5 C-22 (translated from Romanian into English).
C-22 (translated from Romanian into English; stamp and signature on Romanian original).
C-23 (emphasis added, translated into English from Romanian).

According to the Claimants, the Minister of Industry and Commerce controlled and managed those two State-
controlled entities. See C-Request, para. 41.

payment additions existing on 28 February 1999; and (ii) with respect to ROMGAZ
S.A., rescheduling over 12 months the debts existing on 28 February 1999, with a
grace period of six months, and cancellation of the related penalties and delayed

payment additions existing on 28 February 1999.

C. Events Following SOF’s Notice of 3 June 1999 to the Claimants and the

Freezing of Socomet’s Bank Accounts in September 1999

After receiving the Notice of 3 June 1999 from SOF,” the Claimants paid the second
and final installment of the purchase price of their 70 percent shareholding in Socomet

°° and the Claimants

in accordance with Article 5.1 of the Share Purchase Contract
became members of the Board of Socomet.*! Further, so the Claimants allege, to re-
launch production and sales abroad, they created $.C. Gavazzi Steel Consultants
(“Gavazzi Steel Consultants”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands
but wholly owned and controlled by Socomet, to be Socomet’s general agent abroad
in charge of developing its international business and collecting purchase orders from

foreign clients.*?

However, so the Claimants assert, the Restructuring of the Company’s Debt was not
carried out as required by Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract, either within the

contractually specified deadline or any time thereafter.

By letters of 10 June and 2 September 1999, Socomet requested that the Romanian
Ministry of Finance carry out the Restructuring of the Company’s Debt, pointing to

the Company’s unavailability of funds.*>

See supra para. 51.
See supra para. 43. See also the 2007 Romanian Award, at 8, para. 6 (C-6) (“[T]trusting [the] statement [in
the Notice of 3 June 1999 from the SOF 3 that the SOF “had fulfilled all the conditions that were incumbent
upon it pursuant to Article 10.1 (b) of the Contract”], [Gavazzi] paid USD 219,836 (the second instalment)”).
On 9 September 1999, the Claimants were formally registered as members of the Board of Directors of
Socomet with the Romanian Chamber of Commerce, after having been appointed as such at the general
meeting of Socomet’s shareholders held on 9 July 1999 (See Minutes of the general meeting of the
shareholders of Socomet, 9 July 1999 (C-25); C-Request, para. 50).

D. The Romanian Ministry of Finance’s Letter to Socomet Dated 19 October
1999

60. By letter of 19 October 1999, the Romanian Ministry of Finance replied to Socomet’s
letters of 10 June and 2 September 1999 (“19 October 1999 Letter”).*4 The Claimants
contend that the 19 October 1999 Letter, while formally affirming the rescheduling
and waiver of the Company’s debts approved by the Romanian Prime Minister in the
Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, in fact established new terms for the
restructuring of Socomet’s debt that were less favorable to the Company than those
established in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 (and undertaken by
SOF in Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract).

61. The 19 October 1999 Letter, according to the Claimants, introduced a new
rescheduling scheme. In essence, in deviation from the terms of the Share Purchase
Contract and the Government’s Note No. 5/3228, it shortened the original two-year
grace period for the repayment of Socomet’s debt to some 5.5 months, i.e., from

August 2001 to 31 March 2000. Moreover, a substantial part of the penalties were not

4 C-24; R-18. The 19 October 1999 Letter states in relevant part (translated from Romanian into English):
Referring to your letters no. 20252/10.06.1999 and no. 20977/02.09.1999, registered with the
Ministry of Finance under no. 442.311/17.06.1999 and the Otelu Rosu Financial
circumscription under no. 8/07.09.1999, whereby you requested to be granted benefits for the
payment of obligations to the state budget given the temporary unavailability of funds
hereby inform you that, in accordance with Common Note no. 5/3228/RV/17.05.1999, of the
State Assets Fund, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, the Ministry of Health[,] the
Ministry of Finance and approved by the prime minister Radu Vasile, the following were
approved:

 

  

- the exemption from payment of delay penalties related to the overdue state obligations in
total amount of lei 67,288, 123,853, representing delay penalties related to the tax on profit in
amount of lei 9,148,169,519, delay penalties related to tax on salaries in amount of lei
22,256,879,517, VAT related delay penalties in amount of lei 26,370,526,132, delay penalties
related to the research and development fund in amount of lei 743,704,685 and delay penalties
related to overdue loans granted from the state budget based on the provisions of Government
Decision no. 528/1998, in amount of lei 8,768,808,000;

- rescheduling the payment of the total amount of lei 56,099,839,056, representing tax on profit
in amount of lei 4,408,095,093, due tax on salaries in amount of lei 14,694,870,037, VAT in
amount of lei 3,814,601,110, research and development fund in amount of lei 743,704,685,
overdue amounts from loans granted from the state budget in accordance with the provisions
of Government Decision no. 528/1998 and penalties calculated for delayed payment of tax on
salaries in amount of lei 3,438,568,131, in 54 increasing monthly installments starting with
31.03.2000, according to the annex hereto.

 

Granting the payment rescheduling is conditioned upon:

- payment of current obligations to the state budget, no later than 30 days after the due date.
For failure to pay on the due date, delay penalties are owed according to legal provisions.

cancelled but only rescheduled with a high annual interest rate of 36 %.*° Further, the
rescheduling of the debts was subordinated to the payment of Socomet’s current

obligations to the State Budget and subjected to additional conditions — such as a bank

  

guarantee to be provided to the local tax office — that were not mentioned in the Share
Purchase Contract or the Government’s Note No. 5/3228.°° Finally, the Claimants
allege that the debts covered by the 19 October 1999 Letter from the Ministry of
Finance concerned only a portion of Socomet’s taxes and similar debts towards the
Ministry of Finance.*” The Claimants also allege that the debts towards the other

Ministries were not covered by the Order from the Minister of Finance.

The Respondent argues that, while the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May
1999** only established the general terms of a proposal, the Letter of 19 October 1999
from the Ministry of Finance established the terms for the rescheduling in specific
terms, taking into account the Company’s temporary illiquidity. Moreover, so the
Respondent argues, the Claimants were aware of the procedure for the rescheduling
of tax debts.*? The Respondent states that, because the current debts to the State
Budget and the rescheduling installment for January 2001 were not paid, the

rescheduling could not be carried out.’”

For the Claimants, however, the Respondent’s case lacks any foundation and is not
evidenced by contemporaneous evidence. 41 Moreover, so the Claimants submit,
AVAS Memorandum of 2 May 2001 to State Secretary Zelenco indicates that Socomet
was compliant with its rescheduling commitments and would be granted a

rescheduling.”

The Respondent maintains that SOF fully complied with its obligations under the
Share Purchase Contract relating to the rescheduling of Socomet’s debts, “in the sense

that the budget debts, as well as the debts towards the energy and gas suppliers were

in fact rescheduled, and the related penalties were cancelled, as a consequence of the
approval of [the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999], in accordance with
the relevant legal provisions in force.” According to the Respondent, the 19 October
1999 Letter establishes that the Company’s debts to the State Budget were rescheduled
in accordance with the relevant Romanian laws; it does not represent a “second
Release,” as erroneously contended by the Claimants. “4 Tn this connection, the
Respondent produced a letter dated 19 May 2000 from the Ministry of Finance to SOF,
stating that, through its Letter of 19 October 1999, the Ministry of Finance had granted
the Company “the fiscal facilities provided by the legislation in force,” and that, in
accordance with that legislation, “the scheduling of payment may start with a period
of grace of maximum 6 months and not of 2 years, as requested.”
65. Further, the Respondent points out, the Claimants never availed themselves of the
remedies provided under Romanian law to challenge the 19 October 1999 Letter;
indeed, they accepted its terms, as evidenced by the Company’s letter of 3 December

1999 to the Otelu Rosu Tax Authority, which was co-signed by Mr. Stefano Gavazzi.*°

66, The Claimants concede that, in the belief that the Romanian Government would soon
be able to restructure Socomet’s debts as agreed, they continued the operations
through Gavazzi Steel Consultants, which started to sign contracts on behalf of

Socomet and to pay salaries to its foreign managers and suppliers. The Claimants also

injected additional funds into Socomet either directly, using their own personal funds,
or through Gavazzi Steel Consultants.‘” All these actions, the Claimants contend,

allowed Socomet to survive and remain active for some time.

E. The Substantiation Note of May 2001 and the Government’s Decision No.
692 of 19 July 2001

In May or July 2001, APAPS (SOF’s successor) and the Ministry of Finance in a
“Substantiation Note” requested the Ministry of Justice to approve for certain
privatized companies — among which Socomet (which, since 21 April 2000 had
changed its name to “Gavazzi Steel S.A.”"*) — the rescheduling of debts towards the
State Budget and the cancellation of related penalties.‘? The Respondent and the
Claimants draw contradictory conclusions from this ““Substantiation Note.” From the
statement in the “Substantiation Note” that “the privatized companies ... are at this
time fully or partially paying current obligations to all state budgets and special
funds”*® — the Respondent concludes that Socomet had outstanding debts. However,
the Claimants conclude that Socomet had no outstanding debts from the statement in
the “Substantiation Note” that the “purchasers of the stocks of shares of the companies
that are the object of this Note [including Socomet] have fulfilled the obligations
undertaken through the shares sale-purchase agreements signed with the
[SOF/APAPS], due until this time.”>! The Note went on to propose conditions for the
Restructuring of the Company’s Debt that were less favorable than the ones
established for Socomet in Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract and confirmed
by the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999. In particular, it allowed for a
grace period of six months while the grace period initially envisaged had been two

years. The Respondent argues that the Substantiation Note, by its statement “... is

Government Decision of 19 July 2001 (see infra para. 68). C-PHB, para. 57.

submitted for approval,” shows clearly that it did not establish any obligation but had

to be approved by a further Government Decision.*”

In the Government’s Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001*? — also countersigned by the
Minister of APAPS, the Minister of Labour and Social Solidarity, and the Minister of
Public Finances — the Romanian Prime Minister, Mr. Adrian Nastase, implemented
the Substantiation Note for Socomet. The Restructuring of the Company’s Debt
remained subject to conditions that were less favorable than those established in
Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract and confirmed in the Government’s Note
No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999. The original grace period became six months as of 1
August 2001. The Government Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001 further modified the
original conditions to the Claimants’ detriment: for example, it reduced the universe
of debts to be rescheduled; and it unfavorably changed the rescheduling plan originally

established in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.*4

The Romanian authorities, so the Claimants assert, did not even carry out the amended
rescheduling scheme announced in the Romanian Government’s Decision No. 692 of

19 July 2001.

The Claimants 4

 

ssert that, on 15 September 1999, Romanian banks, pursuant to a
directive by the Minister of Finance, froze all accounts of Socomet to recover the
Company’s debts to the State Budget, and then paid these debts, thereby depleting
Socomet’s accounts.°° The Claimants contend that Socomet’s funds deposited in
Romanian banks were in this manner transferred to the Romanian State to pay the very
same debts that Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract had provided to be
rescheduled or canceled and which the Respondent had indeed committed to be

rescheduled or waived by the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.

freezing of Socomet’s bank accounts in September 1999.”).

25

71. All Parties agree that the Company’s bank accounts remained frozen at the request of
the Ministry of Finance till 6 December 1999, when the Otelu Rosu Tax Authority
(Circumscriptia Fiscala Ofelu Rosu) ordered the suspension of five enforcement
orders against the Company partially because some fiscal debts had been paid and
partially because others had been rescheduled by the Romanian Ministry of Finance
on 19 October 1999.*° As of 6 December 1999, the Respondent asserts, the Company
was again able to conduct banking operations in relation to its then current activities.”
However, the Claimants contend, the Ministries continued to claim the payment of old
debts and to block Socomet’s accounts.** For instance, in April 2000, Socomet’s
accounts were blocked by the Labour Department (Caras Severin Labor) which
requested immediate payment of the outstanding and current debts and which
prevented Socomet from paying its workers and suppliers.*? Because debts were not
rescheduled, Socomet had to use its funds to pay such debts and could not redress its
activities. © This, so the Claimants argue, is in great contrast to the original
rescheduling and waiver scheme whereby Socomet would have been released from all
interest and penalties and would only have had to pay 10% of its past debts in August

2002 after having benefited from a grace period until August 2001.°!

72. The Claimants contend that, notwithstanding the freezing of the Company’s bank

Company involving an investment in the Company of USD 20,000,000 within five
years from the payment of the share purchase price in accordance with their

undertaking in Article 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract.

73. On 12 July 2002, Mr. Marco Gavazzi informed AVAS of the negotiations the
Claimants were conducting with potential partners to strengthen the financial basis of
the Company and to implement the business plan.®? Techint S.p.A., an Italian steel
company, and Simest S.p.A., a financial company owned by the Italian Government
to support Italian investors abroad, were among those potential partners, so the
Claimants contend. The business plan provided, among other things, for a financing
of USD 27,000,000 by the Austrian Bank Hypo VereinsBank, to acquire new
‘Consteel’ production technology, developed by Techint S.p.A. In his letter, Mr.
Marco Gavazzi noted that, because all the Company’s bank accounts had been frozen,
the Claimants could not send new funds from abroad to pay the Company’s current
debts to the State Budget, which payment was, in turn, a condition set by the
Government for the Restructuring of the Company’s Debt. Mr. Marco Gavazzi further
pointed out that local Romanian banks had refused credit lines to the Company to pay
its debts because its balance sheet carried the “enormous weight of the old pre-

privatization debts.” ° The Claimants

 

ert that a pledge from the Romanian
Commercial Bank was necessary to implement the investment plan established by the
Claimants, Techint S.p.A., and Simest S.p.A. and financed by Hypo VereinsBank. The
Romanian Commercial Bank, however, refused to intervene because of the existing
freeze of the Company’s bank accounts by the Romanian Government, even if its

intervention would not require direct funding. Mr. Marco Gavazzi concluded, in his

© Letter 12 July 2002 Marco Gavazzi/APAPS (C-35).

© C-Request, para. 75. The 2007 Romanian Award, at 22, paras. 7-8 (C-6) describes these events as follows:
.. From a financial standpoint, the transaction provided that HypoVereinsbank — which
had already expressed its agreement — would raise the funds required for the investment.To
permit SACE’s (the Italian State export credit-insurance company) necessary guarantee of
the investment, the Romanian Commercial Bank was asked to intervene — risk free — in
order to transfer the loan directly to Gavazzi Steel, and to cross-guarantee the initial loan
made by HypoVereinsbank.

 
 

 

.. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that [Gavazzi] supplied sufficient documentary and written
evidence that the non-completion of said financial transaction, having reached an
advanced phase, was due to Romanian Commercial Bank’s refusal to participate, as a
consequence of Gavazzi Steel's inability to accede to current account, following its often
quoted freezing by the Romanian Ministries.

12 July 2002 letter, that the only way to “make a very strong injection of new cash” in
the Company was to bring in a new partner; to this end, his brother Stefano would sell
his 39 percent stake in the Company to Acciaierie Venete S.p.A., an Italian steel
company, which would then provide a cash infusion of USD 5,000,000. AVAS never
replied to Mr. Marco Gavazzi’s 12 July 2002 letter.

Thus, so the Claimants contend, the Romanian Government’s failure to carry out the
Restructuring of the Company’s Debt in breach of its commitments of 17 May 1999,
together with the continued freezing of the Company’s bank accounts, frustrated the
implementation of the business plan. The Respondent objects that the Claimants
themselves were responsible for the blocking of the bank accounts by not paying what
was due to the Respondent. The Claimants, however, reply that the freezing of the
accounts was due to the Romanian authorities not having implemented their multiple

commitments as regards waiver and rescheduling.®

The Respondent further argues that the Tribunal should not take into account the
Claimants’ investment plans, which do not rely upon any signed contemporaneous

document.

The Claimants contend that Socomet became practically insolvent; and that, at this
point, the Claimants could not but abandon their endeavours to revitalize the Company
and, thus, their investment project.®” At the general meeting of the shareholders of the
Company held on 24 August 2002, the Board of Directors recognized the extreme
seriousness of the situation, with the Company being “virtually insolvent.” The Board
concluded that the only viable way to allow the Company to continue with its activities
was a “judiciary reorganization pursuant to Law no. 64.” The Company’s Director
General was charged with setting this procedure in motion. Meanwhile, the
Company’s creditors had already filed an application to initiate such procedure before

the Tribunal of Recita.

G. The Arbitration Proceedings Initiated by APAPS Against Messrs. Gavazzi
in October 2002

On 31 October 2002, APAPS (as claimant) started an arbitration against Messrs.
Marco and Stefano Gavazzi (as respondents) at the Court of International Commercial
Arbitration attached to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Romania and
Bucharest, pursuant to the dispute resolution clause contained in Article 13 of the
Share Purchase Contract (the “2002 Romanian arbitration”). In its request for
arbitration, APAPS alleged multiple breaches by Messrs. Gavazzi of the Share
Purchase Contract and requested that the arbitral tribunal, among other things, should
terminate the Contract, order that Messrs. Gavazzi return the purchased shares, pay an
amount allegedly due for unpaid dividends and pay damages for the mismanagement
of the Company totaling USD 14,000,000. Messrs. Gavazzi, for their part, denied any
liability to APAPS and also pleaded, as a counterclaim, multiple breaches by APAPS
of the Share Purchase Contract. They requested, among other relief, that the arbitral
tribunal terminate the Contract and order APAPS to return the share purchase price
and to pay damages for its breach.® In 2004, during the course of the Romanian
arbitral proceedings, APAPS was succeeded by AVAS; accordingly, for the sake of
convenience, in the following paragraphs the Tribunal will refer to AVAS as the

claimant and the respondent to the counterclaim in the Romanian arbitral proceedings.

The arbitral tribunal, chaired by the late Professor Pierre Lalive, a national of
Switzerland, issued its award on 30 October 2007 (the “2007 Romanian Award”), in
which it dismissed AVAS’ claim and granted Messrs. Gavazzi’s counterclaim in its
entirety.” Thus, it terminated the Share Purchase Contract and, among other matters,
ordered AVAS to return the share purchase price to Messrs. Gavazzi and also to pay
Messrs. Gavazzi a total of € 1,016,386 and USD 13,789,700 in damages. In reaching
these decisions, the tribunal found, inter alia, that Messrs. Gavazzi had been induced

by SOF’s Notice of 3 June 1999,”! to pay the share purchase price and that Messrs.

Gavazzi could have terminated the Share Purchase Contract pursuant to Article

10.1(b) of the Contract, but had not done so.
H. AVAS’ successful challenge of the 2007 Romanian Award

AVAS subsequently challenged the 2007 Romanian Award before the Bucharest
Court of Appeals, which annulled the award by its decision of 22 April 2009, on the
ground that the 2007 Romanian Award “breached the principle of equal treatment, the
principle of observance of the right to defense and the principle of contradiction, which
are public order principles”.”” The Court of Appeals, in a subsequent proceeding,
examined the merits of AVAS’ claim and Messrs. Gavazzi’s counterclaim that had
been decided by the 2007 Romanian Award. By its decision of 16 March 2011,” the
Court of Appeals, inter alia, terminated the Share Purchase Contract, determined that
AVAS should retain the monies paid by Messrs. Gavazzi under the Share Purchase
Contract and rejected as unfounded both the remainder of AVAS’ claims and Messrs.
Gavazzi’s entire counterclaim. Messrs. Gavazzi unsuccessfully challenged both
decisions of the Court of Appeals before the Romanian High Court of Cassation and
Justice, which by decision of 23 February 2012 affirmed the decisions of the Court of

Appeals.”*

THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS
A. The Claimants’ Claims

The Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached its obligations under the BIT
by the following acts and omissions: the Romanian Government was aware that the
Claimants’ purchase of Socomet shares and their planned additional investments in
Socomet depended on the rescheduling and waiver of Socomet’s debts towards
different administrations and that the whole project undertaken by the Claimants

depended upon a rescheduling over five years, with a two-year grace period and a

cancellation of all related penalties, as provided by Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase
Contract. The Government Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, signed by the Chairman
of the Board of Direction of the State Ownership Fund, the Minister of Finance, the
Minister of Labour and Social Protection as well as by the Minister of Health and
formally approved by the Prime Minister, requested the administration to approve the
rescheduling of debts and cancellation of penalties, exactly as these were spelled out

by the Claimants and the State Ownership Fund in the Share Purchase Agreement.

However, so the Claimants allege, the rescheduling and cancellation which the
governmental authorities later envisaged, was substantially more restricted. By the 19
October 1999 Letter, the Minister of Finance only granted a grace period of 5.5 months
and did not cancel a substantial part of the penalties. Moreover, the Letter conditioned
the rescheduling on the constitution of a bank guarantee and the payment of Socomet’s
current obligations to the State budget. No evidence has been submitted of

rescheduling schemes from the other Ministers.

In fact, because Socomet was unable to pay its current obligations towards the State
Budget and its account had been frozen, Socomet never benefited from the
substantially more limited rescheduling granted by the 19 October 1999 Letter.
Likewise, the Government Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001, signed by the Prime
Minister and countersigned by the Minister of Privatizations, the Minister of Labour
and Social Solidarity and the Minister of Public Finances, which was also substantially
less favorable than the initial Government Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, so the
Claimants allege, was never carried out. Moreover, the Claimants contend that, in spite
of the commitment to grant a grace-period of two years — later incorrectly reduced to
6 months — in fact no grace period at all had been granted and Socomet’s bank accounts
were frozen pursuant to a directive of the Minister of Finance to recover the
Company’s debts to the State Budget — the same debts which had to benefit from the
grace-period and rescheduling. Moreover, the Claimants’ 2002 investment plan failed
because the Romanian banks refused to grant credit lines to Socomet because its old
debts weighted heavily on its balance sheet. In August 2002, the Claimants had no
other solution but to file for Socomet’s bankruptcy. In arbitration proceedings for
alleged breaches of the Share Purchase Contract, which APAPS started against the

Claimants in Bucharest, the tribunal granted to the Claimants the return of the share

purchase price and € 1,016,386 and USD 13,789,700 in damages because the
confirmation that the rescheduling, as agreed in the Contract, would be carried out,
had induced the Claimants to pay the share price. However, this award was abusively

annulled on grounds, which, so the Claimants submit, were incorrect.

The Claimants request this Arbitral Tribunal to declare that the Respondent has
breached the BIT, namely Article 2 (“Fair and Equitable Treatment”), Article 4(1)
(“Nationalization and Expropriation”) and Article 10 (“Respect of Specific
Contracts”) by the acts and omissions of its authorities. The Claimants request the
Arbitral Tribunal additionally to declare that the Respondent, through the manner in
which the Respondent’s judicial authorities carried out their judicial functions with

regard to the 2007 Romanian Award, has breached Article 2(5).”>

The Claimants further request the Arbitral Tribunal to order the Respondent to
compensate the Claimants for breaches of the BIT in an amount provisionally assessed

to be at least USD 37,806,720 and € 1,016,386, plus interest at the commercial rate

 

the Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate and just — and to order any other relief as

the Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate.

The Claimants request the Arbitral Tribunal to order the Respondent to pay all the
costs and expenses of this arbitration, the Claimants’ legal fees and expert fees, the

fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID’s other costs.
B. The Respondent’s Response and Counterclaim

The Respondent raises a number of preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the

Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims, which will be discussed hereafter.
On the merits of the case, the Respondent seeks an Award:

- Assessing that the Respondent has not violated the Claimants’ right or
acted inconsistently with any of the Respondent’ obligations under the

BIT;

* The Claimants also assert that the actions of judicial authorities with respect to the 2007 Romanian Award
breached Article 10(1) (“Application of General International Law”) of the BIT. C-Request, fn 104.

32

88.

VI.

89.

90.

- Rejecting the Request for Arbitration in its entirety as not grounded;

- Compelling the Claimants to bear the Respondent’s costs incurred by
the preparation and prosecution of this arbitral proceeding, including
fees and expenses of the arbitrators, legal counsel, experts and

consultants fees, as well as the Respondent’s own internal costs.

Further, the Respondent advances a counterclaim, requesting that Claimants be
compelled to pay to the Respondent USD 20 million (plus costs) as damages caused
to the Respondent because of the Claimants’ failure to comply with their investment

obligations and their mismanagement of Socomet.

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMS

The Respondent contends that, for several reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal has no
jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims and that the claims are inadmissible. The
Arbitral Tribunal will therefore discuss its jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute and
the admissibility of the Claimants’ claims in light of the relevant legal rules, i-e., the

ICSID Convention and the BIT.
A. Jurisdiction Ratione Personae

Article 1(2) of the BIT applies to any “natural or legal person being a national of either
Contracting Party who effected, is effecting or has obliged himself to effect,
investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party...” It is not contested that
both Mr. Marco Gavazzi and Mr. Stefano Gavazzi are Italian nationals and are thus
covered by the BIT (to the extent they have effected investments in Romania). In
addition, they qualify as “nationals of another Contracting State” under Article 25(1)
of the ICSID Convention.

B. Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae

The Respondent argues that (a) the purchase of the shares for an amount of USD

517,020 is not an “investment” for jurisdictional purposes and that (b) the Claimants

have not made the necessary and agreed investments after their acquisition of the

shares.’°

92. As a preliminary point, the Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent that in this
arbitration the notion of “investment” has to be understood pursuant to Romanian law

and Romanian judicial and arbitral practice, i.e., that only “participation in the

 

company assets for the purpose of increasing the company share capital in exchange
for an investor acquiring the equivalent shares””’ can be considered an investment.

Nor is it relevant, in the Tribunal’s view, whether Romanian formalities have been

 

followed so as to have the contribution recognised as an “investment” under Romanian
law. The Tribunal decides that the only relevant issue is whether any contributions by
the Claimants are to be considered as “investments” under the BIT and the ICSID

Convention, as interpreted under international law.

a) The Claimants’ Purchase of Shares in Socomet Qualifies as an “Investment”
Under Article 1(1) of the BIT.

93. Article 1(1) of the BIT defines the term “investment,” in relevant part:

The term “investment” means every kind of assets owned by an investor of one
Contracting Party, including goods, rights and financial means, invested in the
territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and
regulations. The term includes in particular, though not exclusively:

b. shares, stocks, debentures, other forms of participation in companies or
partnerships incorporated in the territory of one Contracting Party and any other
negotiable instrument of credit, as well as public securities in general... ."*

94. The Claimants

 

ssert that their purchase of 70 percent of the shares of Socomet

qualifies

 

protected investment according to the plain meaning of Article | of the
BIT. It falls within the notion of “every kind of assets owned by an investor” and is

covered by the listed protected investments (“shares . . . in companies . . . incorporated

in the territory of one Contracting Party” (Article 1(1)(b)); “claims to money or any
right relating to obligations . . . having an economic or financial value connected with
investments” (Article 1(1)(d)); and “rights of a financial nature accruing by law or by

contract” (Article 1(1)(f)).

95, The Tribunal decides that the Claimants meet the requirements of Article 1(1) of the
BIT as regards their purchase and holding of shares in Socomet in Romania. However,
the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s submission that Article 1(1) of the BIT must be
applied together with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.” It does not suffice for the

Claimants to meet only the requirements of Article 1(1) of the BIT.

 

Under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention
96. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention limits the jurisdiction of ICSID to legal disputes

arising directly out of an investment but does not define “investment.” The
Respondent contends that, in establishing whether the Claimants have made an
investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal should follow
the test established by the ICSID tribunal in Salini Constuttori S.p.A. et al. v. Kingdom
of Morocco (the “Salini test”).*° Under that test, so the Respondent submits, the
investment requirement of the ICSID Convention is only satisfied when the operation
of the foreign investor: (i) brings a contribution in money or other kinds of assets; (ii)
has a certain duration; (iii) has an element of risk; and (iv) contributes to the host
State’s economic development. The Tribunal will discuss successively the various

characteristics of the Claimants’ alleged investments under the Salini test.

97. The Tribunal accepts that the Claimants bear the burden of proving their alleged
investments under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.

(i) Acquisition of Shares as Investment

98. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ acquisition of the Socomet shares is not

an investment in Romania and does not satisfy any of the criteria required by the Salini

® See Salini Constuttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4),

test.°! In support, in addition to Salini, the Respondent refers, inter alia, to the ICSID
decisions and awards in Phoenix Action,®? Fakes,®? Mitchell,** Pantechniki,® and Joy
Mining. 86 The Tribunal notes, however, that these cases do not concern direct

investments in material

 

ets located in the host State, as is the case here. According
to the Respondent, the payment of the purchase price of the Claimants’ 70 percent
shareholding in Socomet to SOF was not a monetary contribution to the company

under the ICSID Convention.*’

99. Thus, so the Respondent concludes, the Claimants’ purchase of shares in Socomet
does not qualify as a protected investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the

ICSID Convention.

100. The Claimants contend that investments aimed at acquiring a lasting management
interest in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor are
“investments” under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.** Besides, so the Claimants
point out, four different ICSID tribunals have accepted that the acquisition by foreign
investors of majority shareholdings in state-owned companies through privatization
contracts with AVAS have to be considered as “investments” under the ICSID

Convention.*?

(ii) Additional Investments

The Claimants contend that, besides their payment for the shares, their actual

contribution to the Socomet project was sizeable.°° The Claimants point out that under

Article 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, they not only had to purchase the shares

but also had to make additional investments for a minimum amount of USD

 

20,000,000 within five years after the share purchase. They submit that they had
intended to take over the Socomet operations and actually had managed the Company
for three years, repaired industrial equipment, set up a subsidiary to develop foreign
markets, engaged Italian experts and provided financing.°! The Claimants also point
out that, in spite of the blocked bank accounts, they were finalizing in May 2002 the
installation of new technology which involved an investment of USD 27 million —
well above the USD 20 million and well before the five year deadline, imposed by the
Share Purchase Contract. °? However, ultimately, this commitment to additional
investment — so the Claimants allege — could not be carried out because the Romanian

bank refused its risk-free participation because of Socomet’s blocked accounts.*

For the Claimants, these investments undoubtedly meet the contribution criterion of

the Salini test.

The Respondent submits that the Claimants failed to achieve the agreed yearly
investment obligation. The investment of USD 20 million provided by Article
8.10.1(a) of the Contract” was “not met,” neither was the additionally agreed USD
2 million to invest in 2001 in the oxygen plant, the cooling water station, buildings
and transformation unit °° completed.°’ The investment project concerning the
introduction of new technology was never carried out and, so the Respondent
contends, cannot be considered at a hypothetical level, as a matter of mere possibility.
The alleged USD 1,490,000 investment by converting Holdeast receivables cannot be
considered as an investment, so the Respondent contends, as this amount was paid

after the expiry of the agreed one-year term on 18 June 2002 and payment was not

The parties amended Article 8.10.1(a) by Addendum No. 2 to the Share Purchase Contract of 7 July 2000, in
which they agreed that the five-year period within which the Claimants were to make the investments and/or
contributions would start to run on 24 June 2000 (“Addendum no. 2/07.07.2000 to Share Sale Purchase
Contract No. 145/19.04.1999 — SC Gavazzi Steel SA Otelu Rosu,” Art. 1 (C-20)).

latter payment cannot be included in the former amount. See R-RPHB, paras. 42-47.

registered with the Trade Registry Office, as required by Article 8.10.2 of the Share

Purchase Contract.°* Nor was it published in the Official Monitor of Romania.”

The Claimants contend that their alleged non-compliance with the Share Purchase
Contract, including the alleged mismanagement of the Company and failure to register
their investments with the Trade Register Office, are irrelevant for the purpose of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The dispute brought before this Tribunal does not concern the
Claimants’ alleged breaches of the Share Purchase Contract, but the Respondent’s

breaches of the BIT.!°° According to the Claimants, the Respondent cannot evade its

  

international obligations vis-a-vis investments made by foreign investors in its
territory under the BIT by relying on its own domestic law or irrelevant contractual
interpretations. 101 Moreover, so the Claimants point out, AVAS itself has indicated

that the share registration had only to be carried out at the end of the five years.'?

The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants’ position. It notes that the ICSID
Convention (or the BIT) imposes no monetary threshold to the notion of investment
and takes the view that actual plans to invest may qualify as “investments” under the
ICSID Convention. Consequently, in the view of the Arbitral Tribunal, not only the
purchase price for the shares paid for the shares but also the Claimants’ other
commitments and plans towards the financing of Socomet constitute “contributions”

satisfying this first element under the Salini test.

(iii) | Duration

Equally, so the Respondent continues, under the Salini test the Claimants’ intended
involvement in the activities of Socomet does not have the required duration to qualify

as “investment.”

° Id. paras. 29-30. Article Art. 8.10.2 of the Share Purchase Contract provides:

The capital investment shall be considered fully achieved on the date of registration with the Trade

107. The Claimants point out that their involvement in the activities of Socomet was of
notable duration. '°? The Share Purchase Contract, for instance, provided that the
Claimants would carry out additional investments after five years. In fact, the purpose
of the Claimants’ involvement in Socomet was to establish a lasting economic

operation based upon their ability to manage Socomet. Their contribution to Socomet,

  

so the Claimants contend, responded to the definition of “Direct Investment” in the

OECD Code of Liberalisation of Capital Movements.!°

. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants’ case that the Claimants’ involvement

in Socomet had sufficient duration to qualify as an “investment” under the Salini test.

(iv) Risk

109. Further, so the Respondent contends, the Claimants did not assume the political risk
typical of an investment and protected under the ICSID Convention. In fact, the

Respondent asserts that the Claimants, professional investors, in any event, themselves

  

caused the Socomet-project to fail by mismanaging the Company and not making their

contractually required investments. !°>

110, The Claimants reiterate that the breaches by the Respondent of the BIT, which are
subject of the present proceedings, precisely involve political risks against which the
BIT protects the investor. The investment failed because of these political risks, not

because of commercial risks.'°°

11

. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants’ case. In its view, there was more

 

ent risk to qualify as an “investment” under the Salini test.

(v) Economic Development

112. The Respondent alleges that the Claimants did not contribute to the economic
development of Romania, which the Respondent considers a decisive element for the
qualification as “investment.” The Claimants contend that an “investment” under the
ICSID Convention does not require a “contribution to economic development.”
Referring to Deutsche Bank A.G. vy. Sri Lanka and other ICSID decisions, the

Claimants

 

ssert that this alleged requirement has been discredited and has not been

adopted recently by any tribunal.'°”

113. In any event, so the Claimants continue, their investment in Socomet in fact aimed at
the economic development of Romania by injecting advanced technology into
Socomet. Moreover, the Claimants made sizable investments in Socomet, by
transferring over USD 2 million to the Company, by waiving claims against Socomet
of roughly an equivalent amount, by granting loans and by paying salaries for key
Italian expatriate personnel. The Claimants also revamped and modernized non-

operational equipment (including rolling mills, a glass-pot furnace, a shear-pressing

 

machine) and repaired part of the infrastructure (such as internal bridges and roads,
residential buildings, a school for workers’ children). These improvements, so the
Claimants maintain, have been recognized and listed in the Plan of Judicial
Reorganization of Gavazzi Steel S.A. for 2004-2010 prepared by Iprolam S.A. and
submitted by both Parties. The Respondent itself, so the Claimants point out, admitted
that Socomet had, at least potentially, a substantive value after the Claimants’

departure. !*

. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees that a contribution to an actual economic development
of the host state is not always a conditio sine qua non to qualify as investment under
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, if this were the case, an investment which

was immediately prevented by wrongful acts or omissions of the host State could

never qualify for protection as an investment, although such protection would be most
needed in such a case. The circumstance that the Claimants’ investment could only be

made partially because of the Respondent’s actions or omissions is thus no

 

impediment to grant these investments the protection under the ICSID Convention,
even when the investments failed and could no longer contribute to the economic
development of Romania. The contribution to economic development should not be
assessed ex post facto. Moreover, in this case, the Claimants’ investments did not
immediately fail: their management and the funds injected in Socomet were an initial

contribution to the envisaged economic development of the Respondent.

c) The 2007 Romanian Award as an “Investment”

115. The Claimants have made an additional, subordinate claim that the Respondent
breached Article 2(3)! and Article 2(5)'' of the BIT, through the manner in which
the Bucharest Court of Appeals annulled the 2007 Romanian Award and the Romanian
courts exercised their judicial functions, in disregard of all applicable legal rules and
standards.!!! The Claimants assert that the Respondent was guilty of a denial of justice
and due process through the abusive annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award by its
national courts. According to the Claimants, abundant arbitral precedents confirm that
abusive conduct by state courts in respect of, not only investment arbitration awards,

but also commercial awards, may constitute a denial of justice and a violation of due

10 Article 2(3) of the BIT provides:
Each Contracting Party shall offer in its territory a fair and equitable treatment for
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in
any way impair by arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
use, iation of capital, liquidation and disposal
of investments as well as the local companies, partnerships or firms in which these
investments have been made.
BIT, Art. 2(3) (English text) (C-4).
110 Article 2(5) of the BIT provides:
Each Contracting Party undertakes to provide effective means of asserting claims and
enforcing rights with respect to this present agreement, to the investment authorizations
and properties. Each Contracting Party shall not impair the right of the investors of the
other Contracting Party to have access to its Courts of justice, administrative Tribunals
and agencies and all other bodies exercising adjudicatory authority.

process. ICSID tribunals are therefore competent, so the Claimants contend, to review

such matters under BITs granting compensation for denial of justice.'!”

116. In any event, so the Claimants contend, the 2007 Romanian Award remains protected

under the BIT because Article 1(1) of the BIT lis

 

as protected investments, among
other things, “credits” and “claims to money or any right relating to obligations,” and
money awards and judgments are considered in international case law as property
rights.'!> The Claimants submit that “by annulling abusively the award that was
rendered in the dispute concerning their rights acquired under the privatization
contract, which transferred to them SOCOMET (their investment in the host country),

Romania has breached their treaty rights concerning that investment.”!\*

117. The Claimants seek damages in the amount of the full value of the 2007 Romanian

Award.

118. The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Claimants’ additional
subordinate claim. The Respondent, relying (inter alia) on the ICSID award in GEA
Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine of 31 March 2011,'!> submits that the 2007
Romanian Award does not qualify as an investment under either the BIT or the ICSID
Convention.'!® The annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award does not “arise directly”
out of the Claimants’ alleged investment in Socomet, as required by Article 25(1) of
the ICSID Convention.'!’ The Respondent contends that the annulment of the 2007
Romanian Award cannot be a breach of the BIT as it follows directly from AVAS’

exercise of i

 

right to request such annulment pursuant to Article 364 of the Romanian

Code of Civil Procedure.!!® In the Respondent’s submission, this claim must therefore
fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The right to request the annulment of an arbitral

award, the Respondent a

 

serts, is unrelated to any investment, predates the 2002
19

 

Romanian Arbitration, and is of general application.

119, The Claimants, in turn, emphasize that they do not contend that the 2007 Romanian
Award represents a distinct “investment.” Rather, the 2007 Romanian Award and the
rights thereby recognized, giving rise to a claim for damages in favor of Messrs.
Gavazzi against AVAS, are an integral part of the investment operation of the
Claimants in Socomet and are protected as such under the BIT and the ICSID

Convention. The BIT requires that the investment overall enjoy due process.'?° For

 

that reason, so the Claimants submit, the Tribunal should entertain, under both the BIT
and the ICSID Convention, the claim relating to the annulment of the 2007 Romanian

Award and the decision from the Romanian courts on the merits.

120,

Ss

The Arbitral Tribunal (by a majority) accepts the Claimants’ case that an award which
compensates for an investment made in the host State is a claim to money covered by
the BIT as an investment. It also accepts, as regards Article 25 of the ICSID

Convention, that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the 2007 Romanian

 

Award forms part of the Claimants’ overall investment. '?! However, the Arbitral
Tribunal also notes that the Claimants only claim compensation for the annulment of
the 2007 Romanian Award as a “subordinated” claim in the event that their “Principal

Claim” of breaches of the BIT is not accepted by the Tribunal.!”? Accordingly, as will

C. No Jurisdiction Over Share Purchase Contract Claims

121.

In the Request for Arbitration, the Claimants claim also for non-compliance by the
State-entity AVAS with the Share Purchase Contract. However, the Claimants have
withdrawn their contractual claim based upon the Share Purchase Contract. Indeed, in
their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants confirm that they are not bringing any claim
based on the Share Purchase Contract.'?> They are not claiming that AVAS’ breach of
the Share Purchase Contract was also a contractual breach by or attributable to the

Respondent itself.

122. The Tribunal takes note of the Claimants’ confirmation that they are not claiming for

breaches of the Share Purchase Contract.

123. However, in the written pleadings, the Parties have argued at great length whether a
claim based upon AVAS’ alleged breach of the Share Purchase Contract would be
admissible in the present proceedings since the counterclaim which Messrs. Gavazzi’s
submitted in 2002 to the Romanian arbitration tribunal, likewise concerned alleged
breaches by AVAS of the Share Purchase Contract — a matter later also decided by the
Romanian courts. Although the question is no longer before the Tribunal, out of
courtesy to the Parties, which extensively have discussed the issue, the Tribunal will

address the issue.

124. Before the Claimants clarified that they did not bring any claim under the Share
Purchase Contract, they had indicated that such claim would be based upon Article
10(2) of the BIT, which the Claimants considered to be “a kind of ‘umbrella
clause.’”!*4 That provision states: “Jn case of specific contracts between an investor
and either Contracting Party, the provisions of these contracts, without prejudice of

the provisions of the present Agreement, will prevail for the concerned investor.”'?>

23 C_PHB, para. 7.
14 C-Request para. 130.
125 BIT, Art. 10(2) (English text) (C-4).

125. The Respondent accepts that a BIT’s so-called “umbrella clause” could elevate a

breach of a contract into a breach of a BIT and thus make it subject of an ICSID

tribunal’s jurisdiction. However, for the Respondent Article 10(2) of the BIT is not a

proper “umbrella clause.”!7°

126, The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Article 10 of the BIT is not to be

interpreted as an “umbrella clause.” Consequently, Article 10 does not grant the

Tribunal jurisdiction over claims based upon the Share Purchase Contract.

12

=

Under the scenario that the Tribunal would have jurisdiction over such claims — quod

non — the Respondent argued that Article 8(2) of the BIT, the so-called “fork in the

road” provision, would exclude such contractual claims, as the claims have already

been brought before other jurisdictional fora.!”’ Indeed, the Claimants had already

elected to bring these claims as a counterclaim before the Romanian arbitration

institution, the forum upon which the Parties agreed in Article 13 of the Share Purchase

Contract. '** By filing a counterclaim in the 2002 Romanian arbitration,

the

Respondent contends, the Claimants “waived their right to pursue a similarly-

grounded claim” before ICSID.!”° Once the investor has chosen a forum to resolve a

certain dispute between the parties, so the Respondent submits, such choice is final;

and the investor can no longer submit the same dispute to another jurisdictional

126 R-PHB, paras. 105-108; R-PO/CMICC, paras. 82-104.
"7 Article 8(2) of the BIT reads as follows:
In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months of the date of
a writt[e]n application, the investor in question may submit the dispute, at his choice, for
settlement to:
a) the Contracting Party’s Court, at all instances, having territorial jurisdiction;
b) an ad hoc Arbitration Tribunal, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the
Commission on International Trade Law” (UNCITRAL). . . . [;]
c) the

However, in specific contracts, investors and Contracting Parties may agree on disputes
settlement procedures.

"8 R-PO/CMICC, para. 52. Article 13 of the Share Purchase Contract, titled “Litigations,” provides:
Seller and Buyer hereby agree that the disputes deriving from the interpretation and
execution of this Contract, that cannot be settled on an amiable way, will be submitted to
the Court of International Commercial Arbitration of the Romanian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.

forum. '*° Moreover, the Claimants’ subsequent actions in the Romanian courts
following the annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award — in particular their appeal to
the Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice'*! — confirm that the Claimants

consented to the settlement of their claim by other fora than this Tribunal.!*?

The Tribunal decides that Article 8 of the BIT cannot be interpreted as a “fork in the
road” clause. It does not offer the Claimants, for disputes arising out of the Share
Purchase Contract, a mutually exclusive choice between the arbitration before the
Court of International Commercial Arbitration of the Romanian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, provided for by Article 13 of that Contract, and the dispute

mechanism provided for by the BIT.

Consequently, this Arbitral Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction to hear the claims
for breaches of the BIT submitted by the Claimants against the Respondent in this

arbitration.
D, Jurisdiction Over Claims for Breaches of the BIT

The Respondent alleges that it did not breach the BIT because the Respondent never
assumed any legal obligation toward the Claimants to reschedule debts and to waive
penalties, neither in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 nor
elsewhere. Under Article 18 of Romanian Law 37, the Prime Minister can issue
individual administrative rescheduling acts. The legal procedure for obtaining such
approval was established in the Privatization Law in force at the time and required that
the Ministry of Finance issue a “fiscal certificate” for Socomet, on the basis of which
a “common order for rescheduling” would be issued signed by the Minister of
Finance.'* According to the Respondent, the Ministry of Finance never issued such
“fiscal certificate” for Socomet because of the “difficult fiscal status of the
company.”'** However, for the Claimants, this “difficult fiscal status of the company”

was precisely due to the accumulated budget debts that were to be cancelled or

rescheduled by the Respondent.'** Thus, so the Respondent concludes, because the
procedure required by law for Government approval for the Restructuring of the
Company’s Debt was never followed, Government Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999

was never vested with “legal force and effect.”!*°

However, in this case, according to the Respondent, all the necessary preliminary steps
had not been carried out by the Ministry of Finance because the stipulated conditions
for rescheduling did not meet the legal requirements of Government Ordinance No.
11/1996, Article 83, and (inter alia) the Claimants had not established a bank guarantee
of 4.5 billion ROL.!5? The Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was
therefore not a promise creating legal obligations for its signatories.'** It did not have
the “legal force and effect” of an administrative act; and therefore it could not bind the

Respondent.!?

The Claimants contend that the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 is “an

7°14 and the Claimants characterize the

administrative act of individual application,
Note as an express approval of the rescheduling and waivers to which the Share

Purchase Contract referred.'"!

In the Respondent’s submission, however, the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17
May 1999 was not issued by the Prime Minister in the exercise of his executive power,
but was merely an “internal communication,” or a “technical-administrative note,”
...“from the Romanian Prime Minister to the various addressees, requesting their
approval”... “prior to the issuance of an administrative act.”!*?

Besides, so the Respondent asserts, the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May

1999 had not been issued either by the Prime Minister or the Romanian Ministries

involved, but rather by AVAS.'3 In the Respondent’s submission, AVAS merely
requested that the competent authorities approve its proposal for the Restructuring of
the Company’s Debt.'“! The Respondent finally points out that at the hearing, Mr.
Marco Gavazzi confirmed that the Claimants were fully aware that Government Note
No. 5/3228 had to be further implemented by an actual Order.'*> For the Respondent,
the Note represented nothing but a first step in the carrying out of a procedure aimed

at obtaining the requested rescheduling.'“°

135. Further, so the Respondent contends, even if the procedure had been followed in full,
the text of the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 necessarily leads to the conclusion that
the Note did not create any legal obligation assumed by the Respondent to allow the
Restructuring of the Company’s Debt. Indeed, the final sentence of the Note reads:
“Considering the above, please approve the facilities regarding the payment of the
said obligations of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu.”'*” The words “please approve”
make it clear for the Respondent that the signatories of the Note did not assume an
obligation to reschedule and waive penalties, but that third parties had to carry out

these matters, if approved.

136, The Respondent concludes that the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 did not, by itself,
grant the Restructuring of the Company’s Debt; rather, it must “be construed as a
favourable premise for the Claimants that they shall be granted the facilities in
question, subject to the observance of the applicable legal provisions.”'“*

137. As a result, so the Respondent concludes, the Claimants have no cause of action
against it under the BIT.'*? Because the Tribunal’s jurisdiction extends only to
breaches of obligations under the BIT, the Claimants’ claim falls outside its

jurisdiction.

138. The Tribunal notes that the issue whether the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17
May 1999 actually approved the rescheduling goes to the merits of the case and is not
material to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. At this stage, it is sufficient to note
that not only the Claimants but also SOF in its 3 June 1999 Notice to the Claimants
was of the opinion that the Prime Minister of Romania had approved the
rescheduling.!*° Consequently, for jurisdictional purposes an allegation of breach of

the Government’s commitments is sufficient to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
E. The Claim Is Not Time-Barred

13)

Ss

. The Respondent’s final objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is that the claims are
time-barred.'*! In the case at stake — so the Respondent argues — the time-bar would
be governed by the substantive law (lex causae), i.e., Romanian law. Indeed, for the
Respondent, because the Parties to this ICSID arbitration did not agree on the law
applicable to the dispute, Romanian law applies as “the law of the Contracting State
party to the dispute,” pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.'** Moreover,
as already indicated above, Article 14 of the Share Purchase Contract provides that the
Contract is “governed by the Romanian law.”!>> Consequently, in the Respondent’s
submission, any issue “related to the execution” of the Contract and “any claim arising
therefrom” are “to be settled in accordance with the legal framework provided by

Romanian law.”'*4

14

S

In the Respondent’s submission, the claims submitted in the present arbitration are
time-barred because they were not submitted within the time period provided for under

the applicable Romanian law! — that is, within three years from the date on which

155 In support, the Respondent invokes provisions contained in Decree No. 167/1958 on the statute of limitations,
and the Romanian Civil Code.
Article 1 of Decree No. 167/1958 (R-10) provides:
Unless exercised within the legally provided deadline, the right to action in respect of a
patrimonial right is extinguished by limitation.

Once the right to action related to a primary right is extinguished, the right to action
related to the ancillary rights will also be extinguished.
Article 3 (1) of Decree No. 167/1958 provides, in relevant part:

49

the Claimants became aware, or should have become aware, of the alleged breach by

Romania of “its obligations.”!%°

141.

The Respondent asserts that the statute of limitations for the Claimants’ claims arising

from the “alleged non-observance” by AVAS of its obligations under the Share

 

Purchase Contract began to run in 1999-2001 when, according to the Claimants,
AVAS failed to perform those obligations. By the time the Claimants submitted their
Request for Arbitration on 23 July 2012, the statute of limitations had thus already

elapsed.!°7

142. Moreover, for the Respondent, the statute of limitations applies to the Claimants’
denial-of-justice claim relating to the annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award. The

prescription began to run on 22 April 2009, the date on which the Bucharest Court of

 

Appeals issued its decision annulling that award.'** Indeed, by that date, so the

Respondent contends, the Claimants were aware (or should have become aware) of
their alleged losses.' Referring (inter alia) to the decisions in Mondev Int'l Ltd. v.

United States of America® and Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v.

16

United States of America,'®! the Respondent accordingly concludes that, by the time

the Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration on 23 July 2012, the statute of

limitations relating to the Claimants’ denial-of-justice claim had already elapsed, too.

law. According to the Claimants, only international law (the law governing the

The Respondent contends that the Romanian Civil Code of 1 October 2011 provides for a three-year statute
of limitations (Article 2517), which starts to run “on the date when the holder of the right to claim is aware
or should become aware that such a right is born” (Article 2523). R-PO/CM/CC, paras. 148-49.

of provisions of the BIT) can determine whether their claims are time-barred. No time-
bar within which an investor must submit a claim to ICSID is established in the BIT,

the ICSID Convention or the Rules of Arbitration.'

144, In any event, the Claimants assert, their claim would not be time-barred even if,
arguendo, Romanian law were applicable. Indeed, under Article 16(b) and Article 17
of Romanian Decree No. 167/1958 on the statute of limitations, the three-year time-
bar would have been interrupted multiple times, and after each interruption, a new
period of three years would have to restart.'®* Specifically, the three-year period would
have been interrupted when AVAS initiated the 2002 arbitration, restarted when the

award was rendered on 30 October 2007, to be stopped again when AVAS commenced

proceedings seeking annulment of the 2007 Award.'*

145. The Claimants had already started the BIT dispute settlement process by submitting
their written request for amicable settlement required under Article 8 of the BIT to
Romania on 20 July 2011, long before the Romanian High Court of Cassation and

Justice had issued the last decision in these proceedings on 23 February 2012 and the

three-year time-bar could restart for the Claimants’ claims in these proceedings.!®

1 C-RI/CC, paras. 81-82, 87; C-PHB, paras. 150-151.

163 Article 16 (b) of Decree No. 167/1958 provides:

The statute of limitation period is interrupted: . . . (b) by the submission of a writ of
summons or request for arbitration, even if such request was submitted with an incompetent
court of law or arbitration body...

Article 17 of Decree No. 167/1958 provides in full:
The interruption discards the statute of limitation commenced prior to the occurrence of
the event that interrupted it.
After interruption, a new statute of limitation period begins.
If the statute of limitation was interrupted by a writ of summons or a request for arbitration
or by a deed initiating enforcement, the new statute of limitation will not run as long as the
decision to admit the request is not final or, in case of enforcement, until the performance
of the last enforcement action. (C-73).

164 The Respondent argues that in fact the statute of limitations of the claims which were not allowed by the
court proceedings in File 8799/2/2007 was not interrupted by these proceedings (R-PHB, para.114). However
as the three-year time bar under Romanian law is not applicable, this assertion does not affect the general
outcome of the decision.

165 C-RI/CC, paras. 83-85; C-PHB, paras. 152-154. Article 8 of the BIT provides, in relevant part:

1) Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of that investor in the territory of the
former Contracting Party, including disputes relating to compensation for
expropriation and disputes relating to the amount of its relevant payments shall
be settled, as far as possible, amicably by consultation and negotiations between
the parties to the dispute.

 

51

Even for the claims that were dismissed by the Bucharest Court of Appeal on 22 April
2009, if a three-year time-bar applied — guod non, the three-year statute of limitations
would start to run from that date but would not have resulted in a time bar on 20 July

2011, when proceedings under Article 8 of the BIT started.

146, Besides, if any national law should be applicable, the Claimants submit (opposed by
the Respondent)!® that it would be Italian law because the Claimants derive their
rights under the BIT from its Italian ratifying Law No. 704/1994. Under Article 2943
and 2946 of the Italian Civil Code, the statute of limitations on all rights is generally
ten years; however, it is interrupted by the filing of judicial or arbitral claims and only

restarts once the related judicial or arbitral proceedings are terminated.'°7

147. The Tribunal decides that the Claimants’ claims are not time-barred. In arbitration
proceedings governed by international law, only international law — and no domestic
law — can introduce time-bars.'® Neither the ICSID Convention, nor the BIT, nor
international law in general contains any statute of limitations in relation to treaty
claims. Without such clear legal provision, no time-bar can operate to bar an ICSID

arbitration.
F, The Majority’s Views on Jurisdiction Over the Counterclaim

148. The Respondent has advanced a counterclaim against the Claimants of USD 20 million
(plus costs) for damages, because of the Claimants’ alleged failure to comply with
their investment obligations and their alleged mismanagement of Socomet, which,
according to the Respondent, culminated in Socomet’s insolvency, deprived the

Respondent of key industrial assets, and led to losses of jobs and local economic

decline. The counterclaim is based on the alleged breach of a number of legal

provisions under Romanian law.'®

149. The Respondent submits that a counterclaim against the Claimants is admissible if the
basis of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the BIT, provides for the possibility for the Host
State to advance a counterclaim against the investor. Moreover, the procedural
framework of the present arbitration proceedings, more specifically Article 46 of the
ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, regulates the

modalities for advancing such a counterclaim.

150. For the Respondent, its right to submit a counterclaim under the BIT has to be

presumed, as the BIT has not expressly excluded such counterclaim.

15

The Tribunal has noted that the BIT, in the second paragraph of its Preamble, indicates
that it aims at “a stable framework ... and maximum effective utilization of economic
resources of either country,” and, in Article 8(1), the BIT refers to “/aJny dispute
between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party
concerning an investment of that investor in the territory of the former Contracting
Party.” Such language may seem to indicate that also the claims of the Host State
against the investor should be covered by the BIT. However, whereas Article 8(1) of
the BIT suggests amicable consultation and negotiations with respect to “[a]ny dispute
between one Contracting Party and an investor,” Article 8(2) of the BIT only grants

the investor the right to claim against the Host State.

152. The Tribunal has pondered how to interpret the absence of an express mention in
Article 8(2) that the Host State may claim against the investor. It has noted that, under
Article 8(3),!” the Host State may elaborate its defence against the investor’s claim
and has considered why the Host State should be limited to opposing the investor’s

claims and not be entitled to install a counterclaim. As a matter of form, a counterclaim

1 The Respondent has specified that its Counterclaim is not a tort claim based upon the Claimants’ alleged
violation of Romanian tax law, as the Claimants suggested (C-PHB, para. 161). See R-RPHB, para. 132;
170 Article 8(3) of the BIT provides:
The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall at no time whatever during the
procedures involving investment disputes, asse[r]t as a defence its immunity as well as the fact
that the investor has received compensation under an insurance Contract covering the whole
or part of the incurred damage or loss.
BIT, Art. 8(3) (English text) (C-4).

154.

z

can be pleaded as a claim operating by way of defence to an investor’s claim or as a
free-standing claim by the Host State against the investor. In substance, however, there

is a significant difference between a defence and a free-standing claim.

The Tribunal has considered whether the omission of any express mention of the Host
State’s right to file a counterclaim is due to the fact that the drafters of the BIT focused
on the protection of the investor. It has also considered whether this omission actually
excludes any counterclaim by the Host State against the investor before the arbitration
forum provided for by the BIT. It has been considered whether the Respondent’s
counterclaim is for damages caused by the investor, which, in the Respondent’s
contention, arise from the investment — or more precisely the failure of investments —
and thus allegedly from the same subject matter as the Parties’ dispute. Since the
counterclaim is allegedly an extension of the Respondent’s defence against the claim,
so the Respondent submitted, the Tribunal was invited to consider that such
counterclaim is included within the consent of the Parties to arbitrate before the
Tribunal their dispute arising from the investment. It further has been raised within the
Tribunal whether the BIT’s Contracting Parties intended to avoid parallel proceedings
and conflicting decisions before different courts and tribunals by preventing the Host
State from asserting its rights against the investor in a counterclaim; and whether such

exclusion would not be a breach of natural justice.

The Tribunal (by a majority), however, does not accept that the right of the Host State
to file a free-standing counterclaim in an investment treaty arbitration should be
presumed unless expressly excluded by the BIT. The majority considers that it is the
letter of the BIT, interpreted under international law, that binds the Parties. Where
there is no jurisdiction provided by the wording of the BIT in relation to a
counterclaim, no jurisdiction can be inferred merely from the “spirit” of the BIT. For
the majority, it is not unusual for parties to be in asymmetrical positions when a dispute
relating to a BIT arises. The majority further observes that the counterclaim submitted
by the Respondent is an entirely independent claim based upon Romanian law and
unrelated to the Claimants’ claim based upon breaches of the BIT. Both in form and
substance, it is a free-standing counterclaim not operating merely as a defence to the
Claimants’ claim. Besides, it is significant that, in the Romanian arbitration and

Romanian court proceedings, AVAS’ claim for compensation for damage allegedly

54

caused by Messrs. Gavazzi’s alleged failure to invest and mismanagement, to a
substantial extent overlaps with the subject-matter of the Respondent’s counterclaim,

submitted in these proceedings.

155, Further, for the Respondent, Article 8(2) of the BIT provides that the international law
provisions of the BIT can be supplemented by Romanian law, applicable to the Share
Purchase Contract. Romanian law allows for a counterclaim. Therefore, for the
Respondent, “it is logical and entirely reasonable to conclude that the Claimants and
the Respondent, as parties subject to the Italy-Romanian BIT, would also be subject

to their rights and obligations arising from Romanian law.”!7!

156. The Tribunal notes that the BIT does not indicate that Romanian law applies to the
substance of disputes. Article 8(2) of the BIT does not import Romanian law as
substantive law to decide claims and counterclaims. By concluding the BIT, the
Contracting Parties agreed to apply the BIT and international law to disputes for
breaches of the BIT. Further, for the Tribunal, it is difficult to accept that two States,
parties to a treaty, have agreed to be subject to a domestic law chosen in a later

contract, concluded by one of the States and private third persons.

157. As for the ICSID Convention, Article 42 of the ICSID Convention — to which the
Respondent also refers — only recognises that, in the absence of an agreement of the
parties on the applicable law, the law of the Host State may apply to investment
contracts, which are the direct subject-matter of the ICSID arbitration. However, in
the present proceedings, not breaches of the Share Purchase Contract, but breaches of
the BIT are the subject-matter of the present arbitration. Therefore, the reference to
the domestic law of the Host State as the law on the merits in Article 42 of the ICSID

Convention, is irrelevant in the present case.

158. Moreover, the BIT does not indicate that Romanian law would apply to the procedural
aspects of the dispute settlement provided by the BIT. Article 8(2) does not make
Romanian procedural law applicable to this arbitration. Article 42 of the ICSID

Convention, does not refer at all to the procedural law of the Host State. On the

163.

contrary, Article 44 expressly states that the procedure before ICSID Tribunals is

regulated by the ICSID Convention itself (as supplemented by the Arbitration Rules).

The Majority therefore concludes that the BIT does not entitle the Respondent to

advance in the present proceedings a free-standing counterclaim.

Moreover, even if such counterclaim would be possible under the BIT — guod non the
counterclaim needs also to be admissible under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention
and Article 40 of the Arbitration Rules, which require that counterclaims (a) arise
“directly from the subject-matter of the dispute;” (b) are within the scope of consent

of the parties; and (c) are within ICSID’s jurisdiction.

For the reasons stated above, for the Majority, the subject-matter of the counterclaim,
ie., violations of Romanian domestic law, do not directly arise from the breaches of
the BIT, being the subject-matter of the present proceedings. Moreover, nothing in the
BIT allows the Majority to conclude that the counterclaim advanced by the
Respondent falls within the scope of claims which could be brought in the present

proceedings under Article 8(2) of the BIT.

On the basis of these considerations, the Majority concludes that it has no jurisdiction

to decide upon the Respondent’s counterclaim.

NO RES JUDICATA OR ISSUE ESTOPPEL BECAUSE OF ROMANIAN
COURT JUDGMENTS

The Tribunal has extensively considered in great detail the impact upon the present
proceedings of the judgment of the Bucharest Court of Appeals of 16 March 2011
(confirmed by the Court of Cassation of Romania). The Court of Appeals set aside the
2007 Romanian Award, decided the merits in AVAS and rejected the counterclaim
made by Messrs. Gavazzi, which was based on the conduct and omissions by AVAS.
The judgment of 16 March 2011 decided only on contractual claims and counterclaims
and found, under Romanian law, that AVAS had not breached the Share Purchase
Contract. The present proceedings concern treaty claims; and this Tribunal has to
decide, under international law, whether the Respondent was in breach of Article 2(5)
of the BIT, which, in the Claimants’ submission, has adversely affected the Claimants’

rights as investors under the BIT.

164. The Tribunal has examined whether the decision on the merits of the Bucharest Court

of Appeals (confirmed by the Court of Cassation of Romania), denying the Claimants

 

compensation for the non-rescheduling and non-waiver of public debts, has conclusive
effects on the Parties to the present proceedings under the doctrine of res judicata or
issue estoppel. If this were the case, the issue whether the Claimants would be entitled
to compensation because their rights have been adversely affected could become moot.
May this Tribunal find, in spite of the Bucharest Court of Appeals’ final judgment
denying the Claimants compensation under the Share Purchase Contract, that the
rights of the Claimants as investors under the BIT have been violated and that the
Respondent is liable for any violation of its treaty commitments? From its perspective
as an international tribunal formed under the BIT, the Tribunal applies international

law as the law applicable to these questions.

165. In deliberating the issue, the Tribunal considered various legal materials, including the
recurring opinions expressed in the decisions in Apotex Holdings et al v. United States
of America,' Amco v. Indonesia,’ The Pious Funds of the Californias,'™ The

Orinoco Case,' Grynberg v. Grenada,'”° and Diag Human SE v. Czech Republic.\”

166, Under international law, three conditions need to be fulfilled for a decision to have
binding effect in later proceedings: namely, that in both instances, the object of the

claim, the cause of action, and the parties are identical.!7*

"8 See Apotex v. United States of America. The Tribunal has already discussed these three conditions in a
different context, when it considered whether the proceedings before the Romanian arbitration court excluded
Gavazzi’s claim under the Share Purchase Contract in the present proceedings under an alleged “fork-in-the-
road” provision in the BIT (see supra paras. 126-127128). As will be recalled, however, the Tribunal did not
find that the BIT contained such a “fork-in-the-road” provision; moreover, the Claimants affirmed that they
were not claiming for a breach of the Share Purchase Contract in the present proceedings.

 

   

57

167.

168.

169.

(1) Object of the Claim

For the Respondent, although the object of the 2002 Romanian arbitration and the
present proceedings are worded and assessed in different manners, the remedy sought
is the same and therefore “identity of object cannot be rejected.” '” For the
Respondent, the object of Claimants’ counterclaim in the Romanian arbitration and of
their claim in the present proceedings is identical. In both instances, the relief they
seek for the alleged breaches is compensation through payment of pecuniary
damages.'*°

By contrast, the Claimants contend that the subject matters of the dispute in the 2002
arbitration and in the present ICSID proceedings are different. The fact that a
contractual claim and a treaty claim might both aim at obtaining monetary damages
(even in similar amounts) is of no relevance; and it does not undermine the well-
established distinction between treaty claims and contractual claims.'*! At issue in the
2002 Romanian arbitration was the alleged compliance with — or the alleged breach of

— the Share Purchase Contract by either AVAS or Mes Gavazzi and the

 

consequences in the light of the applicable Romanian law. At issue in the present
ICSID proceedings are the alleged breaches of the BIT by the Respondent to the
alleged prejudice of the Claimants as Italian investors protected by the BIT under

international law.!**

(2) Cause of Action

For the Respondent, the Romanian arbitration and the present proceedings concern the
same cause of action: in both instances the Claimants refer to the alleged breaches by
the Respondent of the Share Purchase Contract and of the BIT.!* Indeed, so the
Respondent contends, the claims submitted in the present proceedings, although
formally for breaches of the BIT, are in fact contractual claims based upon the Share

Purchase Contract.

170. The Claimants, for their part, argue that the objects of the disputes involved in the
2002 arbitration and in the present ICSID proceedings are different. The remedies

sought in the former were the termination of the Share Purchase Contract; the

 

reciprocal restitution of payments made and of shares bought; and damages for breach
of contract measured in accordance with Romanian law as damnum emergens plus
lucrum cessans. By contrast, the remedies sought in the present ICSID arbitration are:
ascertaining of breaches of the BIT by the Respondent and compensation for an
international wrong (unfair treatment and expropriation) equivalent to the value of the

lost property.!**

17

. The Tribunal (by a majority) finds that the claims before the Tribunal are based upon
a breach of the BIT, and their decision turns on the respective provisions of the BIT,
while in the proceedings before the Bucharest Court of Appeals, the claims were for
breach of the Share Purchase Contract governed by Romanian law, and their decision

turned on the duties and rights under that Contract.

172, Consequently, the present proceedings and the Bucharest Court proceedings had a
different cause of action. Under international law, as confirmed by several

precedents, '*>

there is no identity between the cause of the contractual claims put
before the Romanian courts and that of the BIT claims put before this Tribunal. For
this reason alone, the majority concludes that the Bucharest court decisions cannot
have conclusive [] effect for the Tribunal under the doctrines of res judicata and issue

estoppel.

(3) The Parties

173, The Respondent argues that the Parties in the 2002 Romanian arbitration and in the

 

present proceedings are in fact the same. Although AVAS w:

 

party in the 2002
arbitration and the Respondent is a party in the present proceedings, the Respondent

argues that AVAS’ actions are in the present arbitration attributable to the Respondent,

59

while in the 2002 arbitration the Claimants (as Messrs. Gavazzi in their counterclaim
against AVAS) argued that AVAS’ breaches also encompassed alleged breaches by
the Ministries of Finance, Health and Social Protection, i.e., all executive organs of
the Respondent.'*° However, for the Claimants, the 2002 Romanian arbitration and
these ICSID proceedings involved different parties. The parties to the former were
AVAS and Messrs. Gavazzi, whereas the parties to the latter are the Claimants
(Messrs. Gavazzi) and the Respondent. While AVAS is a public body that depends on
the Government of Romania, under Romanian law it has a distinct legal personality,
is organized pursuant to its own articles of incorporation, and is managed by its own
Board. '87 The Claimants point out that AVAS was the Respondent in the 2002

Romanian arbitration.

174. The circumstance that there is no identity between the relevant parties to the different
proceedings '** only confirms to the majority that the Bucharest Court decision,
denying the Claimants any compensation for non-rescheduling and non-waiver, has
no conclusive effect under the doctrines of res judicata or issue estoppel with respect

to the present proceedings.

VIII. THE MERITS

A. The Principal Claims

 

175. The Claimants assert that Romania’s authorities failed to carry out the Restructuring

of the Company’s Debt, which had been promised to the Claimants, by the following

 

(1) The Government of Romania and the relevant Ministries of

Romania failed to carry out the Restructuring of the Company’s

186 R-RPHB, para 8.

187 C-RI/CC, paras. 42-46.

'88 Tn the Romanian court proceedings, the State of Romania was not a party to the Share Purchase Contract that
was the subject-matter of the dispute, and AVAS, having its own legal personality under Romanian law, was
not identical to the State of Romania. For this Tribunal, the State of Romania cannot be equated to AVAS;
moreover, the Claimants do not hold the State of Romania responsible for breaches of the Share Purchase
Contract (C- PHB para.7).

60

Debt as indicated in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May
1999.

(2) The Ministry of Finance granted Socomet a more limited debt
restructuring in its letter to the Claimants of 19 October 1999 and

subsequently failed to carry out this more limited restructuring.

(3) The Ministry of Industry failed to release Socomet from its debts to
the National Electricity Company CONEL S.A. and the National
Company ROMGAZ S.A.

(4) The Government of Romania granted Socomet a more limited debt
restructuring in its Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001 and

subsequently failed to carry out this more limited restructuring. '®°

 

176. According to the Claimants, the acts and omissions of the Romanian Prime Minister
and the three Ministers, all of whom signed Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 in their
official capacity as members of the Government of Romania and were competent to
bring about the promised Restructuring of the Company’s Debt, are attributable to
Romania under international law, because the Government is an entity of the
Romanian State.!°° The Claimants contend that, through breaches (1) - (4) listed
above, the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard under
Article 2(3) of the BIT and has unlawfully deprived the Claimants of their investment
under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.

17

_

Additionally and subordinately, the Claimants aver that the Bucharest Court of
Appeals abusively annulled the 2007 Romanian Award and that the Romanian courts
wrongly exercised their judicial functions with respect to the contractual dispute

between AVAS and Gavazzi. The Claimants contend that the Romanian courts are

18 In their Request for Arbitration, the Claimants appeared to claim compensation under the alleged “umbrella
clause” of Article 10(2) of the BIT for AVAS’ failure to comply with its contractual obligation under the
Share Purchase Contract to bring about the Restructuring of the Company’s Debt. However, as the Tribunal
has decided above, Article 10 of the BIT is not to be interpreted as an “umbrella clause” (para. 123).
Moreover, in later submissions, the Claimants confirmed that they actually did not bring any claim based on
the Share Purchase Contract, but only on the Respondents breaches of the BIT itself. (C-PHB para. 7)
Consequently, the Tribunal need not here discuss AVAS? alleged failure to comply with the Share Purchase
Agreement.

190 C-Request, para. 113.

61

likewise organs of the Romanian State, and that their acts and omissions are therefore
equally attributable to the Respondent. By annulling the 2007 Romanian Award and
deciding the merits of the contractual dispute between AVAS and Gavazzi, so the
Claimants contend, the Respondent has deprived the Claimants of their investment

under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.

178. The Tribunal agrees that the acts and omissions of the Members of the Government,
the respective Ministries, the governmental administrations, and the courts in relation
to the Claimants’ investment are attributable to the Respondent. Therefore, the

Tribunal will proceed to examine the Claimants’ allegations that the Respondent has:
(a) not respected the “fair and equitable standard” (Article 2(3) of the BIT); and

(b) unlawfully deprived the Claimants of their investment (Article 4(1) and (2) of the
BIT).

179. Given the end-result of this Decision, the Tribunal need not here address the
Claimants’ subordinate claim that the Respondent failed to provide the Claimants with
effective means to assert their claims and enforce their rights under Article 2(5) of the
BIT. However, the Tribunal will nonetheless do so briefly, as a matter of courtesy to

the Parties’ submissions and also because the issue may be relevant to costs.

a) “Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard” Not R d (Article 2(3) of the
BIT)

180, Article 2(3) of the BIT provides:

Each Contracting Party shall offer in its territory a fair and equitable treatment
for investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting
Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory
measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, conversion,
repatriation of capital, liquidation and disposal of investments as well as the
local companies, partnerships or firms in which these investments have been
made.!°!

1 BIT, Art. 2(3) (English text) (C-4). The final paragraph of the BIT states that the BIT was done “in three
original copies, each in Italian, Romanian and English languages, all texts being equally authentic” and
provides that in case of “differences of interpretation,” the English text “shall be considered as the text of
reference.”

(i) The Parties’ Contentions

The Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable
treatment standard contained in Article 2(3) of the BIT (“Fair and Equitable Treatment
Standard”) through the Romanian government authorities’ unjustified failure to accord
the Claimants’ investment the treatment that was promised to them. More specifically,
the Claimants argue that, in not carrying out the promised Restructuring of the
Company’s Debt, which was an essential and explicit condition for the Claimants to
sign the Share Purchase Contract, the Respondent breached the Fair and Equitable
Treatment Standard. According to the Claimants, the Romanian authorities have thus
engaged in “arbitrary” and “discriminatory” measures that “impair[ed]” and,
ultimately, destroyed the “management, maintenance, use, [and] enjoyment” of the
Claimants’ investment in “/ocal companies” within the meaning of Article 2(3) of the
BIT.'” The Claimants submit that this conduct is “manifestly inconsistent, non-
transparent, unreasonable (i.e. unrelated to some rational policy), or discriminatory
(i.e. based on unjustifiable distinctions),”!°* and in breach of the Fair and Equitable
Treatment Standard.'**

The Claimants further argue that the Respondent created a legitimate expectation on
the Claimants’ part that it would carry out the Restructuring of the Company’s Debt
by its solemn promise in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.!°> That
promise, according to the Claimants, induced the Claimants to pay the second
installment under the Share Purchase Contract and to perform its contractual
obligations, which the Claimants otherwise would not have done, and which
performance caused them great damage. By acting contrary to its explicit promises to
the Claimants in respect of their investment, the Claimants argue, the Respondent has
breached the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard of Article 2(3) of the BIT.!” In

support of this argument, the Claimants refer to several decisions by ICSID tribunals

Mar. 2006) (emphasis added).

96 C-Request, paras. 108, 121; C-PHB, para. 80.

that reached the same conclusion in analogous circumstances.!*” For instance, the

Claimants point out that the ICSID tribunal in Toral v. Argentina decided:

117. «. The expectation of the investor is undoubtedly
“legitimate”, and hence subject to protection under the fair and
equitable treatment clause, if the host State has explicitly assumed a
specific legal obligation for the future, such as by contracts,
concessions or stabilisation clauses on which the investor is therefore
entitled to rely as a matter of law.

118. The situation is similar when public authorities of the host
country have made the private investor believe that such an obligation
existed through conduct or by a declaration. Authorities may also have
announced officially their intent to pursue a certain conduct in the
future, on which, in turn, the investor relied in making investments or
incurring costs. As stated within the NAFTA framework “the concept
of ‘legitimate expectations’ relates . . . to a situation where a
Contracting Party’s conduct creates reasonable and justifiable
expectations on the part of an investor (or investment) to act in reliance
on said conduct, such that a failure by the NAFTA party to honour those
expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to suffer
damages. ”'°*

183. In response, the Respondent denies that it has breached the Fair and Equitable
Treatment Standard contained in Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Respondent denies that
it ever promised the Claimants that it would carry out the Restructuring of the
Company’s Debt described in Article 10.1(b) of the Share Purchase Contract. In the
Respondent’s view, the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was merely
an internal communication from the Prime Minister to the various addressees,
requesting the approval of the proposed debt rescheduling within the limits of the
applicable law. For the Respondent, that Note did not, by itself, grant the Restructuring

of the Company’s Debt, as sought by the Claimants. It was only “a favourable

premise” to grant the Claimants a restructuring of Socomet’s debts, subject to the

observance of the applicable legal provisions.'”

The Claimants take a diametrically opposite view, arguing that the Government’s Note
No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was not merely an internal memorandum. On the contrary,
it was a true administrative decision “of individual application” addressed to the
Claimants and SOF.°° The Claimants moreover emphasize that SOF, another State
authority, explicitly confirmed in its Note No. P/2994 of 28 May 1999 to the Romanian
Minister of Industry and Commerce that the Romanian Prime Minister had approved
the Restructuring of the Company’s Debt.”"! Also, APAPS, the successor of SOF,
confirmed that the Rescheduling, as described in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228,
had been “approved in the session of the Government of Romania held on

17.05.1999,”

The Respondent points out that the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999
had a limited scope. The Note did not provide for a rescheduling of all public debts.
Only payments to the State Budget, to the Social and Health Insurance Budget and to
Special Funds were included within the scope of the Note; payments for
supplementary pension, for the unemployment help fund and for the health insurance

fund, were not covered.

Moreover, the Respondent asserts that, in any event, SOF performed its obligations
under Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract to facilitate the rescheduling of
Socomet’s budget debts.?°? For instance, within 40 days after the signature of the
Share Purchase Contract, SOF requested the Minister of Industry and Commerce to
approve the restructuring of Socomet’s debts and the cancellation of delay penalties
owed to its electricity and gas suppliers, CONEL S.A. and ROMGAZ S.A.?° SOF
thus fulfilled its obligation under Article 10.1(c) of the Share Purchase Contract “to

exert all diligence” and to “support” the Claimants in achieving the rescheduling of

the Company’s debts to those two companies.°° In fact, the Respondent asserts, these

debts were rescheduled.”°°

Likewise, the Respondent asserts that the rescheduling of the other debts within the
scope of Article 10.1(b) had been carried out. For instance, the Romanian Ministry of
Finance did, in accordance with the applicable law, reschedule the tax debts on 19
October 19997°7 and did cancel the related penalties.?°* The Claimants, in their letter
of 3 December 1999 to the Otelu Rosu tax authorities, accepted the rescheduling.”
The Respondent further alleges that Socomet received additional payment facilities

with respect to its debts to the State Social Insurance and Health Insurance Budgets.!°

(ii) The Tribunal’s Decision

In examining the alleged breaches by the Respondent of its obligations under the BIT,
the Tribunal will not dwell on the manner SOF has performed its obligations under the
Share Purchase Contract. Under Article 10.1(c) of the Share Purchase Contract, SOF
had diligently to support the Claimants in the rescheduling of Socomet’s outstanding
debts and the cancelling of its penalties and additional payments for delay to CONEL
and ROMGAZ. SOF requested this rescheduling from the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce on 28 May 1999 and supported Socomet’s request to CONEL and

ROMGAZ. It therefore performed its contractual obligations. However, as indicated

205 R-PHB, paras. 357-359.
206 In support of this assertion, the Respondent relies on

a letter dated 7 October 1999 from S.C. Distrigaz-Nord S.A. (one of ROMGAZ’ successors) to S.C.
Gavazzi Steel S.A. (R-23) (in its letter, S.C, Distrigaz-Nord S.A., among other things, made the October
1999 “internal natural gas supply program” for Gavazzi Steel S.A. contingent on the Company making
specified payments and submitting a number of promissory notes);

a “Debt Rescheduling Report” dated 29 May 1999, signed by Stefano Gavazzi on behalf of S.C. Gavazzi

as amended and supplemented by Government Ordinance No. 53/1997 and subsequent enactments (namely,

above, the performance by SOF of its contractual obligations under the Share Purchase

Contract is not within the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal will therefore only examine whether the Respondent, through its
respective State entities, has breached its obligation to grant the Claimants’ investment
fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Claimants, of course,

bear the legal burden of proving any breach.

In asst

 

ssing this matter, the Tribunal must first examine the importance of debt

rescheduling for Socomet.

In 1999, Socomet was heavily indebted to Romania and to various organs of the
Romanian State. The success of the Claimants’ investment in Socomet depended on
the rescheduling of these debts and upon the waiver of the related penalties. Under
Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, Socomet’s debts to the ‘State Budget,
Budget for Social Assurances, Health Budget, including credits from the Ministry of
Finance for paying the power and gas supply, had to be rescheduled within 5 years
with a 2 year grace period and all related penalties and additional payments for delay

had to be cancelled.”

Consequently, the Claimants agreed to pay USD 517,020 for 70% of the shares in
Socomet and to invest an additional USD 20 million within 5 years on the condition
that the respective Romanian governmental entities would reschedule Socomet’s debts
towards them and would waive penalties and delay payments as provided by Article
10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract. Were this condition not met, the Claimants were
entitled to terminate the contract and receive reimbursement for sums already paid

towards the purchase price.

On 17 May 1999, well within the 40 days after the signature of the Share Purchase
Contract, the Romanian Prime Minister, on the request of the Minister of Finance, the
Minister of Labor and Social Protection, and the Minister of Health, referred to the
rescheduling condition of the Share Purchase Contract and approved the restructuring

of:

“the debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu that are overdue and unpaid

on time to the State Budget, the Social Insurance Budget, the Health Budget

67

and Special Funds, over a period of 5 years, with a grace period of 2 years.
Subsequently, the payments shall be done as follows: 10% in the third year,
30% in the fourth year and 60% in the last year, as well as the cancellation

of all related penalties and/or delay penalties.”?''

194, The exact amount of the debts to be rescheduled or waived was to be verified by

DGFPCFS Caras Severin, the regional administration.

195.

a

In this Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, which bore the official stamp of the Prime
Minister, the head of the Romanian Government, and three of his Ministers,
acknowledged that they were familiar with the Share Purchase Contract, and that they
were aware of the fact that the requested rescheduling and waivers were, for the
Claimants, a preliminary condition for the purchase of the Socomet shares, for the
assumption of the direction of Socomet, and for the additional investment of USD 20
million into Socomet’s further operations. Aware of this fact, the signatories of the
Government’s Note confirmed that the Claimants could cancel the Share Purchase
Contract if this rescheduling was not granted within 40 days after the signature of the
contract. Consequently, as provided under Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract,
the Government’s Note No. 5/3228, issued within the contractual 40 days after the
signature of the contract, would rightly be considered as a formal grant of the required
scheduling. It is, therefore, evidence that the rescheduling and waiver, as required
under Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract, had been obtained within the

envisaged timeframe.

196,

a

Indeed, SOF, a specialized governmental institution in charge of privatizations,
understood the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 to be exactly such a grant by the
highest State authorities, of the rescheduling and waivers as provided for by Article
10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract. SOF invoked this grant in its request of 28 May
1999 to the Romanian Ministry of Industry and Commerce to reschedule Socomet’s
energy debts. For the purposes of the present case, it is particularly crucial to note that
SOF also confirmed to the Claimants on 3 June 1999 that all the conditions imposed

by Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, including the rescheduling of

2 See supra para. 54.

68

Socomet’s debts to the State Budget, the Social Insurance Budget, the Health Budget

and Special Funds and cancellation of the related penalties, had been met.?!?

197.

a

Shortly after having been informed that the Government had approved the
rescheduling and waivers, as provided for by the Share Purchase Contract, the
Claimants paid the second and final part of the share purchase price (USD 297,184),
joined the Board of Directors of Socomet, and created Gavazzi Steel Consultants to

develop Socomet’s international business.

198.

oe

The Tribunal decides the merits by majority vote. It agrees with the Claimants that, by
the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, four Ministers of the Romanian
Government, including its Prime Minister, granted and approved the rescheduling and
waivers as required by the Share Purchase Contract. They justifiably considered this
Government’s Note as such — subject to further implementation of this rescheduling

and waiver by the administrations concerned.

199. The Tribunal cannot, as the Respondent does, reduce the Government’s Note No.
5/3228 to a mere internal communication to different administrative addressees of the
Prime Minister’s approval of some rescheduling and waivers, to the extent allowed by
other legal provisions. The four Ministers who signed the Government’s Note were
well aware that the rescheduling and waivers were the preliminary condition of the
Claimants’ investment in Socomet. They were also well aware that the Government’s
Note would be notified to the Claimants, and would be considered by them the actual

grant of the rescheduling and waiver, as required by the Share Purchase Contract.

200. Most importantly, the Tribunal observes that the Respondent in fact has never
implemented the rescheduling and waivers granted in the Government’s Note No.

5/3228 of 17 May 1999.

201.

Indeed, on 19 October 1999 the Romanian Ministry of Finance formally affected to
implement the rescheduling granted in the Government’s Note of 17 May 1999 but in
fact proposed less favorable terms. The grace period was shortened from two years to
5.5 months. 75 A substantial part of the penalties was not cancelled as the

212

See supra para, 52.
23-The argument that the applicable law allowed only for a grace period of a maximum of 6 months does not
convince the Tribunal, The Government’s Note No. 5/3228 explicitly granted a grace period of 2 years and

69

Government’s Note No. 5/3228 had indicated but was only rescheduled (with an
interest rate of 36%). Furthermore, the rescheduling was subordinated to Socomet’s
payment of current obligations to the State Budget and to Socomet’s establishment of
a bank guarantee for rescheduled payments — conditions not at all mentioned in the
Government’s Note No. 5/3228 and which the Claimants could not fulfill because of
lack of funds. Moreover, in fact the partial rescheduling, proposed by the Ministry of

Finance in October 1999, was never carried out.

202. For many months, the other Ministries involved in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228

did not even implement any rescheduling or waiver.

203.

wo

On 19 July 2001, a Government decision by the Prime Minister, countersigned by the
Minister of Finance and Minister of Labor and Social Solidarity, provided for a
rescheduling of some — not all — of the debts that were covered by the Government’s
Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.7!4 Moreover, the rescheduling scheme that this
Government Decision envisaged was less favourable than the scheme of the
Government’s Note, among other reasons because the grace period was reduced again
from 2 years to 6 months. The 2001 rescheduling scheme likewise was never carried

out.

204. The Claimants correctly understood the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May
1999 as the grant of the rescheduling and waivers, foreseen in the Share Purchase
Contract. They reasonably relied upon the Note and were justified in expecting that
the rescheduling and waiver would be implemented within a short time, as outlined by
the Government’s Note. The issuance of the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 thus
induced the payment of the second and final part of the share price, as well as the
membership of the Claimants of the Board of Directors and management of Socomet,

and the Claimants’ investment in Socomet’s operations.

205. In fact, the rescheduling and waiver, envisaged by the Government’s Note No. 5/3228,
were never carried out by the Romanian Government, its Ministries and lower

administrations, whose acts and omissions are attributable to the Respondent under

did not submit the modalities of the rescheduling to legal restrictions. The Government’s Note No. 5/3228
thus created legitimate expectations for the Claimants.

ex

international law. Consequently, by failing to implement the rescheduling and waivers
granted in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, the Respondent
obstructed the legitimate expectations of the Claimants and has not treated them in a

fair and equitable manner as required by Article 2(3) of the BIT.

Due to the fact that the public debts were not rescheduled or waived as promised in
the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, Socomet had to use its funds to
pay these debts and Socomet became deprived of funds to finance its operations. When
these debts were not paid, Socomet’s Romanian bank accounts were frozen and
Socomet could no longer finance its operations and further investments. Instances in
which this happened included the freezing of Socomet’s accounts by the Romanian
Ministry of Finance in the autumn of 1999, and the blockage of Socomet’s accounts

by Caras Severin Labour in April 2000.

In August 2002 this situation ultimately resulted in Socomet’s insolvency, by which
the Claimants lost all the funds they had invested in the Socomet operations. The
Tribunal concludes that the facts, as related above, which ultimately led to Socomet’s
insolvency, constitute a breach by the Respondent of the Fair and Equitable Standard,
contained in Article 2(3) of the BIT. The heads of damages and the quantification of
the damages, caused by this breach, will be discussed in the quantum phase of these

proceedings.
b) Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT

Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT provides:

(1) The investments to which this Agreement relates shall not be subject to any
measure which might limit permanently or temporarily their joined rights of
ownership, possession, control or enjoyment, except where specifically provided
by law by judgments or orders issued by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction.

(2) Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized, requisitioned or
subjected to other measures having directly or indirectly similar effect (all of these
measures hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”), unless the following
conditions are fulfilled:

a) the measures are adopted in the national interest, or for public purposes
and in accordance with due process of law;

71

b) the measures are not discriminatory, compared to the measures taken
against national investments and investors or against the investments and
investors of third countries;

c) a proper procedure is established to determine the amount and method of
payment of compensation.?!>

(i) The Parties’ Contentions

209. The Claimants assert that the Respondent’s failure to effect the Restructuring of the
Company’s Debt, in conflict with the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999,
led to forced cash withdrawals in favor of the Government creditors and to the
blocking of the Company’s bank accounts, which limited the Company’s potential for
investments, frustrated ia. a new investment by Techint and ultimately led to
Socomet’s insolvency, depriving the Claimants of all their investments in the Socomet
project.7!° After the insolvency, AVAS had the Company valued at USD 22 million?!”

and subsequently sold it to other investors.7!*

210. The Claimants allege that the Respondent breached its obligations under Article 4 of
the BIT in three different manners. First, by blocking the Company’s bank accounts,
the Respondent subjected the Claimants, in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT, to a
“measure which might limit permanently or temporarily their joined rights of
ownership, possession, control or enjoyment,” which was not “specifically provided
by law” or “judgments.”?'? Second, (i) by not implementing the Restructuring of the
Company’s Debt; (ii) by blocking, and forcing withdrawals from, the Company’s bank
accounts; and (iii) by forcing the Company into insolvency, the Respondent subjected
the Claimants to “measures having directly or indirectly similar effect [to

expropriation, nationalization, or requisition],’ which deprived them of their

25 BIT, Art. 4(1)-(2) (English text) (C-4).

26 C-Request, para. 124; C-PHB, para. 89.

27 The Claimants refer to the “Plan of Judicial Reorganising of the Company S.C. Gavazzi Steel S.A. Otelu
Rogu,” prepared by Iprolam S.A., Institute for Designing Rolling Sections and Plants, Bucharest (C-57; R-
52), which, according to the Claimants, in 2004 ascribed to the Company, inter alia, a liquidation value of
USD 22 million. C-PHB, para. 92 n.120.

218 In support, the Claimants rely on the hearing testimony of Mr. Florin Frumosu, a former member of the Board
of Directors of Gavazzi Steel S.A. and the Company’s Director General from May until July 2002, who stated
that the Company and/or its assets were sold first to another Italian investor and subsequently to a Russian
investor.

investment in breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT.?”° Third, by not implementing the
2007 Romanian Award and having a Romanian court instead decide on the merits of
the dispute, the Respondent did not respect the “proper procedure [for] determin[ing]
the amount and method of payment of compensation,” breaching, according to the

Claimants, Article 4(2)(c) of the BIT.?7!

The Respondent, however, alleges that the Claimants themselves triggered the
insolvency of Socomet in three different ways. First, Socomet (by now the Company
was called Gavazzi Steel) controlled by the Claimants, forfeited the debt rescheduling
and waiver, which had been granted on condition of such payment, by failing to fulfill
some payments, thus leading to the blocking of the Company’s bank accounts. Second,
the Claimants failed to make the necessary investments as provided for in the Share
Purchase Contract, which was a condition for the rescheduling and waiver. Third,
Claimants’ general mismanagement of the Company inevitably led to the insolvency

of Socomet.

(1) Non-payment of Overdue Debts to the State Budget

The Respondent asserts that the Company failed to comply with the conditions for the
debt rescheduling as set forth in the Ministry of Finance’s letter of 19 October 1999,
which, for instance, still required payment of the Company’s outstanding debts to the
State Budget.”?”? Thus, the Respondent contends that in February 2002, the General
Directorate of Public Finance had to attach cash deposits on Gavazzi’s Steel’s bank

. 2
accounts in order to cover these debts. 7°

For the Claimants, the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 did not require
payment of outstanding debts to the State Budget. The blocking of the bank accounts

C-Request, para. 127; C-PHB, para. 91.

21 C-Request, para. 128.

22 In support, the Respondent relies on “computation notes” and “computation minutes” prepared by the General

Directorate of Public Finance of Caras-Severin County in 2002 (R-PO/CM/CC, paras. 258-59). The
Claimants point out that the “computation notes” did not concern current payments due by the Company but
rather the debts that should have been first suspended and thereafter rescheduled under the Ministry of
Finance’s letter of 19 October 1999 (C-PHB, paras. 67-69).

23 R-PO/CMICC, paras. 260-63; two notices of garnishment dated 25 February 2002 (R-34; R-35). As noted,
the Respondent alleges that the previous freeze of the Company’s bank accounts, which had occurred in
September 1999, was lifted on 6 December 1999. The Respondent asserts that the Company never challenged
those garnishments, even though it could have done so under Government Ordinance No. 11/1996 on the
Enforcement of Budget Debts.

73

in February 2002 confirms that the broad rescheduling and waivers, granted in the
Government’s Note No. 5/3228, were never implemented. Even the less favorable

rescheduling proposals of 19 October 1999 by the Ministry of Finance, or by the

 

Government’s Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001, were never implemented.

(2) Lack of Investments

214, Article 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract provides:

Buyer commits himself to effect in the Company either by own sources and
provided [i]n his name or by a third Party he attracted, within a period of
maximum 5 (five) years starting with the Payment Date, investment /
contribution to capital as provided by law, in a total value of 20,000,000
USD (out of which the environmental investments represent 480,000
USD), scheduled according to Annex No.6.274

215. Article 8.10.1 was amended by the Addendum of 7 July 2000, postponing the start of

the 5 year investment period to June 2000:

Purchaser undertakes to bring in the company out of his own sources,
brought on its name, or by a third party, brought by the purchaser, for a
period of maximum 5 (five) years, commencing on 24.06.2000
investment/capital contributions, in the forms provided by law, in a total
amount of 20,000,000 US$...2>

216. The Respondent alleges that the Claimants failed to make the investments in the
Company as required by the Share Purchase Contract. This failure, so the Respondent
maintains, was another direct cause of the Company’s insolvency and eventual

insolvency and liquidation.?”°

para. 46.

26 R-PHB, para. 237 et seq. Article 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, the Claimants undertook to make
investments or contributions in the Company totaling USD 20,000,000 within five years “starting with the
Payment Date.” In Addendum No. 2 to the Share Purchase Contract, the parties agreed that that five-year
period would run from 24 June 2000 (see supra paras. 46 and 215); thus, under the Share Purchase Contract,
as amended, the Claimants were to make the total investment/contribution of USD 20,000,000 by June 2005,
the first installment totaling USD 2,000,000 being due by the end of June 2001. In response to a request by
the Claimants that the deadline for the first installment be extended by six months to the end of 2001, APAPS
replied:

According to [the Share Purchase Contract], you are not supposed to certify to A.P.A.P.S.
... that the investments made each year have been included in the company’s social capital.
It is expressively [sic] indicated that this obligation is to be carried out only at the end of
the 5 years period of time, after the complete fulfillment of the investment programme. . . .

217. The Parties have discussed at length the extent to which the Claimants were obliged
to make investments in the Socomet project under the Share Purchase Contract and

the extent to which the investments were actually made.

218, The Respondent asserts that, under Romanian law, an investment in a company
requires participation in its capital through the exchange of shares. Financing a
company without increasing its registered capital would not be considered an
investment. The Respondent points out that, pursuant to Article 8.10.2 of the Share
Purchase Contract, the capital investment would only be considered achieved on the
date of registration of the nominal capital increase with the Trade Register Office.?”7
The Claimants, however, counter that the funds that Messrs. Marco and Stefano
Gavazzi provided to cover the various needs of the Company between 1999 and 2002
qualified as an investment and had only to be converted and registered as capital
increase by June 2005, the deadline established under Article 8.10.1 of the Share

2
Purchase Contract, as amended.”

219, The Tribunal observes that Article 8.10.2 indeed requires that the capital investment
be made by capital increase, and that such capital increase had to be registered with
the Trade Register Office, but (by a majority) that the capital increase did not have to

occur before June 2005.

220. However, independent of the issue of whether registration for a capital increase was
required when the investment was made or later, by June 2005, the Parties disagree on

whether specific operations by the Claimants by their nature could be considered as

In conclusion, we consider it is not necessary the time being to sign an Amendment [to the
Share Purchase Contract] in order to lengthen the first investment year until 31" of
December 2001... .

27 Article Art. 8.10.2 of the Share Purchase Contract provides:
The capital investment shall be considered fully achieved on the date of registration with the
Trade Register Office of Company of the nominal capital increase with their counter value or,
as the case may be with the cash subscribed and fully paid capital, made by the Buyer or a
third Party he attracted.

®8 The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has acknowledged that, “prior to the initiation of the Lalive
Arbitration, the Claimants made an increase of the Company share capital [] by USD 2,000,000 by
converting the Company's debts towards Holdeast S.p.A., owned by the Claimants, into shares.” The
Respondent adds, however, that “there is no evidence to prove the recording of this increase with the Trade
Registry” (R-PHB, para. 156).

75

“investments.” For instance, the Respondent argues that neither the injection of the
Claimants’ personal funds into the Company as a loan, nor the conversion of the

Company’s debts into loans, should be given the status of investments.””°

22

In this connection, for the Respondent “it is important to determine the juridical nature
of each sum of money introduced in [the Company] pursuant to the domestic
(Romanian) legislation.”?°° Thus, the Respondent contends, the distinction under
Romanian law between “investment” and “financing” must be respected. According
to the Respondent, the amounts that the Claimants allegedly “used for SOCOMET’s
establishment — namely amounts paid directly to the Company or paid to third parties
[on] its behalf’ — do not represent investments but, rather, “financing” because they

“confer[] the right to interest payments.”?*!

222. In sum, the Respondent concludes that there is no evidence that the Claimants
“invested” in the Company, either directly or through Gavazzi Steel Consultants.
Specifically, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have provided no
documentary evidence supporting their allegations, such as bank documentation and
other documents showing that the amounts alleged by the Claimants “were paid within
the Company’s accounts as investments.” 7°? For the Respondent, the witness

testimonies and the minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and shareholders of

>» The Claimants allege that funds in the amounts of USD 1,265,000 and € 438,000 had already been duly
registered in the accounts of the company (C-RPHB, para. 11; C-RL/ON/A/CC, para. 88). In support of this
argument, the Claimants rely on a document entitled “Situation of Loans Made by Mr. Gavazzi, Entered in
the Book-Keeping Records of SC Gavazzi Steel S.A.,” signed by the Company’s Economic Director and by
an official of its Chief Bookkeeping Department (C-61, translated from Romanian into English).

 

For instance, the Claimants considered a conversion of a debt that Socomet S.A. owed Holdeast SRL, an
Italian company wholly owned by the Claimants, to be an investment of USD 1,490,255. However, for the
Respondent, this conversion cannot be considered an investment due under the Share Purchase Contract,
because this conversion was discussed only after December 2001, the deadline for providing the first portion
(totaling USD 2,000,000) of the contractually required USD 20,000,000 investment (R-PHB, para. 244). That
debt resulted from the liquidation of Easteel, which was being performed by a Resita court (Minutes of a
meeting of the Board of Directors Gavazzi Steel S.A. held on 1 February 2002; C-36).
The Shareholders’ Meeting of 30 April 2002 decided that the corresponding increase of the Company assets
should be registered as capital with the Trade Register (C-RPHB, para. 11; Minutes of the General Meeting
of the Company’s Shareholders, 30 Apr. 2002 (C-25)). The Claimants point out that the Respondent itself
admitted that this conversion took place and even indicates an amount of the full USD 2,000,000 (C-RPHB,
para. 12). The Respondent contends that, however, the conversion of this debt into shares was not recorded
with the Trade Registry (R-PHB, para 156 n.44).

the Company proffered by the Claimants, suggesting investments, represent “pro

causa evidence.”

223. The Claimants, on the other hand, refer to their negotiations with Kinglor, Techint,
Simest and Hypo Vereinsbank to introduce new “Consteel” technology operations, in
order to revitalize the Company’s outdated plant and production and to introduce
Techint to join Gavazzi Steel as a new major shareholder. This operation, which would
have involved an additional investment of some USD 20,000,000, was ultimately not
realized because Gavazzi Steel’s bank accounts remained blocked. For the
Respondent, however, the Claimants did not submit any convincing proof that this
potential investment project would ever have materialized — the potential project can,

. . . 2
in no events, be considered an actual investment.?*

224.

ase

Finally, the Respondent observes that the Claimants did not respect their investment
obligations under Annex No. 6 of the Share Purchase Contract, even as amended by
the Addendum of 7 July 2000. Amended Annex No. 6 provides that USD 2,000,000
would have to be invested during the period 24 June 2000 - 23 June 2001 with the
following “Investment objectives”: “Oxygen factory,” “Cooling water station
Constructions,” “Transformation post.” It further provides that USD 4,000,000 would
have to be invested during the period 24 June 2001-23 June 2002 with the following
“Investment objectives”: “Stoves and accessories.”?*4 No evidence has been submitted
that the Claimants invested in these specific items within the imposed timeframe of

June 2000 to June 2002.

For the Respondent, the main cause of Socomet’s insolvency was the Claimants’

faulty management of the Company from July 1999 onwards.?*

The Respondent contends that Socomet was profitable before the Claimants took over
the Company but became insolvent under the Claimants’ management. Socomet’s 31
December 1998 balance sheet shows that the Company was not in financial difficulties

in July 1999, as the Claimants allege.?*°

The Claimants contend that Socomet had made no profit in 1998; the nominal profit
of Lei 1.315 billion (equaling some USD 70,000), as entered on the 31 December 1998
balance sheet, must be considered against the massive Lei 115.486 billion in “[d]ebt-
related penalties not included in the balance sheet.”?5’ As Claimant Mr. Marco
Gavazzi testified at the hearing, after he and his brother joined the Board of Directors
of the Company, they discovered that the indication of a profit on the 31 December
1998 balance sheet was “false.”?** The Respondent submits that the Claimants, as
Directors of the Company, did not take any judicial action against those responsible
for the alleged irregularities in the balance sheet and, thus, had “tacitly assumed
responsibility and liability for the financial situation of the Company.”?*?

To prove the Claimants’ mismanagement, the Respondent refers to the Minutes of the
Board of Directors of the Company between July 1999 and August 2002, which show
that, in that period, the Company did not pay its current debts to the State Budget and

laries

 

to its suppliers, that loans were not used for business purposes, that workers
were not paid (which led to strikes), that revenues from export operations were not
transferred to the Company’s accounts (but to Gavazzi Steel Consultants), that the

Company ceased production, and that the Company’s equipment was stolen.

The Claimants contend that they created a Virgin Islands offshore company, Gavazzi

Steel Consultants, to develop Gavazzi Steel’s international business, to employ and

pay Italian steel engineers for operating and modernizing the factory,“° to collect
purchase orders from foreign clients, and, generally, to assist the Claimants in

managing the Company.”*! The Respondent, however, is of the opinion that Gavazzi
ging pany. P Pp

 

Steel Consultants was not necessary for the operations of Gavazzi Steel and that its

real purpose was to benefit from the tax advantages of the Virgin Islands by, inter alia,

 

on on obtained

 

obliging the Company to pay Gavazzi Steel Consultants a 3% commi:

orders, thus depriving the Company of necessary funds."

230. The Respondent stres:

 
 

s that it never approved the creation of Gavazzi Steel
Consultants. The permission from the Romanian Central Bank to allow Socomet to
transfer USD 100,000 for the acquisition of Gavazzi Steel Consultants is, for the
Respondent, no proof that the Respondent considered Gavazzi Steel Consultants to be

an investment under the Share Purchase Contract.”4*

231.

Actually, as the Claimants point out, the Company lacked the necessary funds to pay
these USD 100,000, and the Claimants intended only to transfer GBP 1,000, the
amount equal to the nominal capital of Gavazzi Steel Consultants. As the Company in
fact never paid this amount, Gavazzi Steel Consultants remained fully owned by the

Claimants.” Moreover, the Company never paid any commission to Gavazzi Steel

240 The Claimants contend that Socomet could not employ those technicians directly due to restrictive Romanian
legislation and the fact that the Italian steel engineers did not agree to their salaries being paid in Lei (C-
RPHB, para. 30).

See supra para. 56. The Claimants assert that they announced, at their first meeting of the Board of Directors

on 9 July 1999, the creation of Gavazzi Steel Consultants in order to advise “SOCOMET in sales and

marketing matters and in obtaining production orders . . .[Gavazzi Steel Consultants] would be based on the
technical and professional skills of top firms and sales professionals that prefer to work with Western
companies and who would be in charge with European and Mediterranean markets.” (“Minutes of the Board
of Directors of S.C. Socomet $.A.,” 9 July 1999 (C-36) (C-RPHB, para. 30)). At the same meeting, the

Claimants continue, Mr. Marco Gavazzi announced his intention “to transfer the shares of the new company

to SOCOMET SA, in a ratio of 100%, a percentage that would avoid future misunderstandings with the

Romanian tax authorities” and conflicts of interest (C-RPHB, para. 30).

Steel Consultants B.V., 25 Aug. 1999 (C-65). The Respondent alleges that the Claimants did not inform the
other members of the Board of Directors of Gavazzi Steel S.A. of the existence and role of Gavazzi Steel
Consultants, or of the conflict of interest between the two companies.

Consultants, and the salaries of the Italian engineers, totaling USD 500,000.36, were

entirely paid by the Claimants.”>

232. Moreover, the Respondent continues, on 5 December 2001, Gavazzi Steel authorized
the company Mi & Cor Comaltex S.R.L. (“Mi & Cor”), its exclusive sales agent for

the domestic market, to mortgage the Company’s assets to obtain loans and to incur

new debt,”° as arbitrator Dr. Dragos-Alexandru Sitaru confirmed in his dissenting

opinion to the 2007 Romanian Award." As another example of mismanagement on
the part of the Claimants, the Respondent refers to the imprudence of Mr. Stefano
Gavazzi in signing a blank check, which was subsequently filled out for an exorbitant

amount and refused by the bank.”

233. For the Respondent, the Claimants’ mismanagement was also illustrated in the letter
of 8 January 2001, by which Gavazzi Steel’s General Manager requested the
Romanian Minister of Finance to investigate the Company’s privatization — which the
General Manager termed “fraudulent” — and its economic results.” In his letter, the
General Manager complained that (i) the investments of USD 2,000,000, due for the
period 1 June 1999 — 1 June 2000, had not been made; (ii) that the Company’s debts
had increased from Lei 321,636,058,000 as of 31 July 1999 to Lei 483,518,635,860

245 In support, the Claimants rely on a statement dated 26 September 2002 by Banca Commerciale Lugano

(Switzerland) (C-62) and on an internal Gavazzi Steel Consultants memorandum (“Pro-Memoria”) dated 26
Dec. 1999 (C-63).
In this context, three Italian former employees sued Claimant Marco Gavazzi before the labor court in Como,
Italy for payment of unpaid salaries. This labor dispute, the Respondent contends, resulted in a decision by
the Como court on 4 September 2001, ordering Marco Gavazzi to pay three months’ salaries to the
employees. The decision of the Como court was confirmed by the Cassation Court in Rome on 6 April 2006
(R-PHB, paras. 186-87).

743/2002, Dissenting Opinion of Dragos-Alexandru Sitaru (30 Oct. 2007) (R-3).

48 In May 2002, Claimant Stefano Gavazzi lefi a signed blank check in the Company’s safe, to be used in case
of emergency while he was in Italy undergoing surgery. This check was abusively filled out in the amount
of Lei 9,999,999,999 [at that time the equivalent of some € 333,000] by the Company’s Director General
(who was subsequently dismissed), triggering Socomet’s insolvency (hearing testimony of Claimant Marco
Gavazzi; Hearing Transcript, 3 June 2014, at 425). The check later wound up in the hands of Mi & Cor,
which, according to the Claimants, used it to blackmail Gavazzi Steel S.A. (C-RPHB, para. 32; hearing
testimony of Florin Frumosu (HearingTranscript, 4 June 2014, at 586-587)), before finally presenting it to
the Romanian Commercial Bank. Payment on the check was refused and Claimant Stefano Gavazzi was
charged for, among other things, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, and “crimes related to companies.” He was
later acquitted. (Criminal File No. 0048/01; 0049/01 (R-49, translated from Romanian into English)).

on 31 November 2000; (iii) that the Company’s assets had been “decimated” through
“asset sales” and “massive scrapping and dismantling of equipment”; (iv) that the
production of “electro-steel and rolled products” had decreased; (v) that exports had
decreased significantly; (vi) that the Company had embezzled the compensation paid
by the Romanian State for laying off 500 employees by hiring outside staff at the same
level with the lay-offs, thereby practically “annulling” the effects of the lay-offs; (vi)
that employee salaries had not been paid in time, resulting in strikes; and (vii) that
Claimant Stefano Gavazzi, contrary to assurances he had given, “left the company”
on 22 December 2000 for the winter holidays in Italy, “leaving it without electricity
and pit gas.”25°
234. The Respondent further refers to the conclusion of Iprolam S.A, the judicial liquidator
of Gavazzi Steel, that “[i]nefficient management” had been one of the causes of the

difficulties Gavazzi Steel had encountered.”*!

235, The Respondent concludes, therefore, that because of the Claimants’ mismanagement,
the value of the Company’s net assets decreased from Lei 68,056,056,000 in 1998 to
Lei 44,894,261,000 in 2002, receivables were not collected, and the Company’s debts
increased threefold between the end of 1998 and the end of 2002.?°?

(ii) The Tribunal’s Decision

236. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the Company’s insolvency was triggered
by its failure to pay the increases for overdue debts to the State budget and by the
blocking of its bank accounts, which resulted from this failure. However, neither
Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, nor the Government’s Note No. 5/3228
of 17 May 1999 mentioned that overdue debts would remain payable by the Company.

[T]he [described] illegalities . . . (including the privatization) have occurred after my
dismissal on 8.02.1999 from the position of GENERAL MANAGER of OCOMET SA,

person who was a PNTCD member. After my dismissal, I was forced to retire starting with
01.06.1999, and on May 17, 2000 I was re-assigned as DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER,
and starting with 01.12.2000, appointed GENERAL MANAGER of SC GAVAZZI STEEL

On the contrary, they granted a general waiver of “the Company’s debts to State
Budget, Budget for Social Assurances, Health Budget, including credits got from the
Ministry of Finances for paying the power and natural gas supply,” as well as the
“cancellation of all related penalties and/or delay penalties.” In fact, the blocking of
the Company’s bank accounts, as well as the diversion of its funds to occasional
payment of these debts (instead of investments and operations of the plant), were
precisely caused by the Respondent’s failure to implement its obligations assumed in
the Government’s Note No. 5/3228. The Respondent is not entitled to argue that the
Claimants caused the non-implementation of the rescheduling and waivers and thus
its own insolvency because of the failure promptly to pay “increases for overdue debts
to the State budget,”?°? since the rescheduling and waivers, to which the Respondent

committed itself, included these debts.

237. The argument that the Company’s failure and subsequent insolvency was due to
insufficient investments has been discussed by the Parties in great detail as to whether
investments were made by the Claimants and, if so, which investments were made.
However, the Tribunal is conscious that the debts, which had to be rescheduled or
waived under Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract and the Government’s Note
No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, have actually not been waived or rescheduled. The
Respondent argued that the Claimants have not exercised their right to cancel the
Contract as a result of the rescheduling or waivers not being granted within 40 days of
the signature of the Contract, but the rescheduling and waivers remained a preliminary
condition for the Claimants’ performance of their investment obligations even if the
contract had not been cancelled. The Government’s Note No. 5/3228 expressly

mentions that the rescheduling and waivers were a condition for these investments.

238. Consequently, the Claimants were entitled to suspend investments they were obliged
to make under the Contract, as long as they had not obtained the rescheduling and
waivers under the conditions granted in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May
1999. The Tribunal agrees with the findings in the 2007 Romanian Award that the
failure to reschedule and/or waive the public debts as provided for by the

Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was “fundamental, enduring and

253 R-PHB, para. 293.

82

paralyzing,” and that the Claimants’ lack of investments was therefore “logically and
3254

chronologically subsequent and secondary in importance.
239. The insolvency was not, as the Respondent alleges, entirely or partially triggered by
the lack of investments required under the Share Purchase Contract. On the contrary,
the Respondent’s own failure effectively to reschedule and waive the debts as provided
in the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 ensured that these investment

could not be carried out.

240. The Tribunal by majority concludes that the Respondent’s acts and omissions
following the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, without justified legal
basis, solely and exclusively limited the Claimants’ right of possession, control, and
enjoyment of the funds they invested in the Company, in breach of Article 4(1) of the
BIT. These investments have been subjected to measures having directly or indirectly
similar effect as an expropriation in breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT, whereby the
measures, in view of Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, were not
adopted in accordance with due process of law. The Tribunal does not have to decide
whether the measures are discriminatory (Article 4(2)(b) of the BIT) or whether a
proper procedure was established to determine the amount and method of payment of
compensation (Article 4(2)(c) of the BIT). Consequently, the Tribunal decides that, in
the present case, the Respondent has breached Articles 4(1) and (2) of the BIT by its
failure to reschedule and/or waive debts as set out in the Government’s Note No.

5/3228 of 17 May 1999.

241,

The Tribunal emphasizes that the preceding paragraphs discussed the notion of
“investment” in the light of the Claimants’ contractual obligation to invest under the
Share Purchase Contract. This issue has to be distinguished from the extent to which
contributions that the Claimants have made to the Socomet project qualify as a
“protected investment” under Article 1(b)/(d)/(f) of the BIT, which latter issue may

have to be discussed further in the quantum phase of the present proceedings.

242. The Tribunal is aware that various events occurred as to the Company in the four years
after the Claimants acquired the majority of its shares. The Minutes of the meetings of

the Board of Directors refer to even more incidents and difficulties than the ones raised

24 2007 Romanian Award, at 18 (C-6).

83

by the Respondent. Indeed, the Claimants certainly also encountered fierce obstruction
from the Company’s workers, staff, and suppliers. The Tribunal will hear further
submissions during the quantum phase of the proceedings on these difficulties and
incidents as well as other matters, which may be attributable to factors for which the

Respondent bears no legal responsibility under the BIT.

B. The Claimants’ Additional, Subordinate Claim Under Article 2(5) of the
BIT

a) The Claimants’ Position

243, The Claimants submit that, by its judiciary annulling the 2007 Romanian Award and
rendering its decision of 16 March 2011, by the judgment of the Court of Appeals of
Bucharest confirmed on 23 February 2012 by the Romanian Court of Cassation, the
Respondent breached its duty to ensure to them “effective means of asserting rights”
and “enforcing rights” with respect to their investment, thereby violating the
Claimants’ due process rights and committing a denial of justice, within the meaning
of Article 2(5) of the BIT:

Each Contracting Party undertakes to provide effective means of
asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to this present
agreement, to the investment authorizations and properties. Each
Contracting Party shall not impair the right of the investors of the other
Contracting Party to have access to its Courts of justice, administrative

Tribunals and agencies and all other bodies exercising adjudicatory
authority.>>

244. The Court of Appeals annulled the 2007 Romanian Award on the ground that it
“breached the principle of equal treatment, the principle of observance of the right to
defence and the principle of contradiction, which are public order principles.”?°°

245. The Claimants contend that the Court of Appeals utterly misrepresented the record of
the arbitral proceedings. In support of their contentions, the Claimants refer inter alia

to the 2007 Romanian Award,”°’ to the procedural orders issued by the arbitral

255 BIT, Art. 2(5) (English text) (C-4). (Emphasis added.)

2001,7°° to the Rules of Arbitration of the Court of International Commercial
Arbitration attached to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Romania and

Bucharest,” and to the expert testimony of Professor Sergiu Deleanu.7°!

To counter the Respondent’s argument that the arbitral tribunal should have appointed
its own expert, instead of relying on the Claimants’ expert (see below), the Claimants
proffer that, in Romania, as elsewhere, international arbitral tribunals may rely on
expert evidence provided by party-appointed experts and are not restricted to
considering expert evidence provided by tribunal-appointed experts. To address
Respondent’s objection that, as Romanian courts would have to appoint their own
court-expert, the arbitral tribunal should have done the same, the Claimants assert that,
even if different rules may apply in Romanian domestic judicial courts, such domestic

court practice is irrelevant for international commercial arbitration.

The Claimants further specify that the arbitral tribunal in the 2002 Romanian
Arbitration actually afforded both sides the opportunity to present reports prepared by
party-appointed experts: Gavazzi thus submitted the Deloitte & Touche report,
whereas AVAS submitted an 2003 Auditing Report and the Iprolam Plan of Judicial
Reorganization of Gavazzi Steel S.A. In addition, the Claimants aver, the arbitral
tribunal, by unanimous decision, afforded both parties ample opportunity to comment
on the admissibility, presentation, and content of the evidence. AVAS, however, did
not avail itself of this possibility, nor did it make use of the possibility it had requested
to hear its witnesses in Bucharest. Also, AVAS, according to the Claimants, did not

challenge the minutes of the witnesses heard in Milan.

 

According to the Claimants, all this evidence shows that both parties had ample
opportunity to make their case and to submit evidence (AVAS itself produced an

expert report on damages), and that the parties also had full opportunity to challenge

the partial lack of video transmission and its replacement by written witness statements
(which replacement was agreed to by the parties and the arbitral tribunal), if they so

. 2
wished.?

249, The Claimants contend that, in annulling the 2007 Romanian Award, the Court of
Appeals manifestly breached Romanian law as well as UNCITRAL, ECHR, and
general arbitration principles, which limit the grounds for the annulment of an award
to serious departures from fundamental notions of public policy and procedural

ice.?6

 

jus Referring to the legal opinion of their expert witness on Romanian law,
Professor Sergiu Deleanu, the Claimants assert that the arbitral tribunal had “not

breached the public policy of Romanian private international law, and that Romanian

 

courts have wrongly assessed that a violation occurred in this respect....”?°' According

to the Claimants, Romanian scholarly writing confirms that, under the Romanian Code

of Civil Procedure, Romanian courts have to interpret very strictly the grounds for

annulment of an arbitral award. Very few requests for annulment have ever been

successful.?°

250. The Claimants are of the opinion that the Romanian courts were neither entitled to
extensively review the merits of the international commercial arbitral award, nor to

decide the counterclaim on the merits.

25

. The Claimants conclude that the Court of Appeals’ annulment decision deprived them,
in “breach of property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights”, of
USD 14,377,352 and € 1,163,468, granted to them by the 2007 Romanian Award as

compensation for their investment.” In this context, the Claimants point out that

Annulment of Arbitral Awards, THE EUROPEAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN ARBITRATION REVIEW 2012
(published by Global Arbitration Review) 82, 84 (C-45). In this connection, the Claimants also rely, among
other things, on the written legal opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu, who concludes that “the application
of [the] grounds for setting aside an arbitral award [] as made by the Court of Appeals of Bucharest and
accepted by the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the AVAS-Gavazzi case are totally in contradiction
with the consolidated European and Romanian jurisprudence on the matter, as well as with Romanian
scholars specialized in it.” Legal Opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu, School of Law, University “Babes-

international decisions considered that final awards compensating a foreign investor,
such as the 2007 Romanian Award, are property rights or, more appropriately, part of

the protected investment.”

252, The full amount of damages suffered by the Claimants because of breaches of the BIT,
the Claimants assert, corresponds to the full value of the 2007 Romanian Award, plus
the attorneys’ costs incurred by the Claimants in the annulment proceedings before the

Romanian judiciary.?*

b) The Respondent's Position
253, The Respondent denies that it has breached Article 2(5) of the BIT. In support of its
position, the Respondent relies on the views expressed by its expert witness on

Romanian law, Professor Bazil Oglinda,”°

who confirmed that the Court of Appeals
acted lawfully in annulling the 2007 Romanian Award on the ground that it violated
Romanian public policy pursuant to Article 364(i) of the Romanian Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”), which provides for annulment if i.a. the award “infringes the
public policy, the principles of morality or the imperative legal provisions.”?”° For the
Respondent, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Award violated the
equal treatment of the parties, AVAS’ right of defense as well as the adversarial
principle. The Respondent points out that also European legal systems and the
UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration allow annulment

2
on such grounds.?7!

254, The Respondent endorses the Bucharest Court of Appeals in its decision that it was
unacceptable that the arbitral tribunal had relied on an expert report produced by
Gavazzi*” in breach of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure: the complexity of the

case would have required the Arbitral Tribunal “to perform a specialized expert

appraisal,”?” rather than basing itself on a unilateral expert report which the parties

had requested to be reviewed by an independent expert.

255. For Professor Oglinda, the Respondent’s expert, in cases where “amounts of money”
are at stake, “accounting reports are essential, because the arbitrators are no experts
and it will be very hard for them to pronounce a legal sentence [sic: award] in the
absence of such a proof.”?”* By ignoring AVAS’ request that the arbitral tribunal
appoint an “international expert” to establish the damages suffered by the parties,?’°

the arbitral tribunal committed a “serious infringement of the fundamental principle .

 

. . of the right to a fair trial,” in the sense that a refusal or omission by a tribunal to

decide a request for evidence constitutes a breach of the adversarial principle.?”°

25

s

As also the Court of Appeals stated, for the Respondent, Gavazzi’s report was only an
“extrajudicial document.” During the evidentiary hearing, it was clarified that by this
term Respondent referred to a unilateral document produced by Claimant during those
proceedings.*”’ The Respondent agrees with the Court of Appeals that the arbitral
tribunal’s reliance on the “Master Plan Regarding the improvement of the Steel-plant
department”, prepared by Kinglor Ltd. for Gavazzi Steel S.A. in April 2002,278 and
the “Plan of Judicial Reorganization of Gavazzi Steel S.A.,” prepared by Iprolam
S.A.,2”? instead of appointing an independent expert, had to be sanctioned, because a
document produced by a party cannot form the basis to award damages when both
parties have requested the appointment of an independent expert on the very issues
addressed by such a document.”*? The Respondent also agrees with the Court of

Appeals that the arbitral tribunal had erroneously stated that AVAS had acquiesced in

773 Bucharest Court of Appeals, Commercial Section A VI-A, Commercial Decision No. 65 (Case No.
8799/2/2007), at 10 (22 Apr. 2009) (C-38, translated from Romanian into English).

24 Hearing testimony of Bazil Oglinda (Hearing Transcript, 4 June 2014, at 666). The Respondent, in this
connection, argues that, in the absence of a report on the assessment of damages prepared by a tribunal-
appointed expert, the arbitral tribunal “could not have issued an award,” and that, if there is “a need for a
specialist to express [an] opinion concerning a matter in a trial[,] the respective court must resort to such
expert.” R-RPHB, para. 123.

that report’s conclusions,”*! and that the arbitral tribunal had wrongly based its 2007

Romanian Award on witness statements that could not be video-recorded due to

 

technical problems, thereby rejecting AVAS’ request to hear the witnesses in
person.”*? More generally, the Respondent concurs with the Court of Appeals’ opinion

that the arbitral tribunal did not afford to AVAS the “actual pos:

 

sibility” to support its
arguments, invoke evidence, challenge Messrs. Gavazzi’s evidence, and _ file
procedural objections.”** Therefore, according to the Respondent and the Court of
Appeals, the 2007 Romanian Award was based only on evidence presented by Messrs.

Gavazzi, without regard to AVAS’ rights.?**

257. The Court of Appeals, so asserts the Respondent, did not annul the award because it

 

 

disagreed with the arbitral tribunal’s ssment of the evidence, but rather because of

“breaches of the fundamental principles of procedure under Romanian law.” 7°

Further, the Respondent asserts, the Court of Appeals did not review the merits of the

dispute in the proceedings to annul the 2007 Romanian Award, but did so under Article

366 CCP only after the award was set aside, in order to render a decision on the

merits.?°°

258, Furthermore, the Respondent alleges, the Claimants were afforded a full opportunity
to exercise their rights of defence and to present their case before the Court of Appeals,

both in the 1 proceedings and in the subs proc s on the merits.

 

They also availed themselves of their right of appeal. Accordingly, Respondent

By admitting the action, the court will annul the arbitration award and, if the state of the

the arbitration convention. However, if the ruling on the substance requires new evidence,
the court will rule on the substance after such evidence is produced. In this last case, the
annulment decision may only be challenged at the same time with the decision on the
substance.

contends that at no time did it “’impair Claimants’ right to have access to [Romania’s]

courts of justice” within the meaning of Article 2(5) of the BIT.2*”

c) The Tribunal’s Decision

259, The Tribunal recalls that Article 2(5) of the BIT requires Romania to “provide
effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights” and that it may not “impair

the right of access to its Courts of Justice.”

260. The Tribunal takes the view that whether the Respondent has breached Article 2(5) of
the BIT may be decided based on the reasoning of the tribunal in White Industries v.
India,?** where the tribunal expounded on the application of the “effective means”
standard in BITs. This Tribunal notes that “effective means,” also the language used
in Article 2(5) of the BIT at hand, is a wide notion that does not guarantee that each
and every decision is correct. In the present case, the Tribunal notes that the complaint
was not that there was no effective means for the Claimants to assert their claims and
enforce their rights. Nor was the complaint that Romania has not respected the
separation of powers and that the Romanian government has intervened in the judicial
decision-making. Nor has it been alleged that the courts intended to deprive the
Claimants of their fundamental rights. The Claimants criticize only that the decision

that was arrived at, was wrong.

261, The Tribunal examines also the issue whether the Romanian courts’ annulment of the
2007 Romanian Award amounts to an abuse of rights contrary to the international
principle of good faith, i.e., did they interpret and apply Article V(2)(b) of the New
York Convention in a discriminatory manner???

262. This, in the eyes of this Tribunal, does not constitute an argument of a denial of justice

but relates to judicial discretion, which is inherent in the application of the law and
certainly in the assessment of public policy considerations. As was stated in Frontier

Petroleum Services Ltd. v. Czech Republic:

287 R-RL/RJ/CC, para. 670; R-PHB, para. 418.

288 White Industries Australia Limited v. The Republic of India, Final Award (UNCITRAL), para. 11.3.2 (30
Nov. 2011).

2 Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. Czech Republic, Final Award (UNCITRAL), para. 525 (12 Nov. 2010).

90

526. ... [T]he reference to “public policy” in Article V
(2)(b) of the New York Convention refers to... the particular
national conception of international public policy that is
relevant rather than to a conception of public policy that is in
some way detached from the legal system at the place where
recognition and enforcement is sought...

 

527. ... States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in
determining what their own conception of international public
policy is.°°

263. The Tribunal does not find proof that the Romanian Courts have abused the notion of
“public policy” taking into account that they were entitled to interpret and apply this

notion to protect essential principles of the Romanian legal order as they perceived it.

264. Moreover, the Tribunal accepts — with Dolzer and Schreuer — that even a “clear and

malicious application of the law” might be covered by the principle of due proce:

 

The principles of access to justice, fair procedure, and the
prohibition of denial of justice relate to three stages of the
judicial process: the right to bring a claim, the right of both
parties to fair treatment during the proceedings, and the right
to an appropriate decision at the end of the process. In Azinian
v. Mexico, [the tribunal found that] “[t]here is a fourth type of
denial of justice, namely the clear and malicious application of
the law.”””'

However, in the present case, nothing along the lines of a “clear and malicious

application of the law” has been proven by the Claimants.

 

265. The Tribunal also bears in mind the well-known passage from Brierly’s The Law of

Nations:

It will be observed that even on the wider interpretation of the
term “denial of justice” which is here adopted, the misconduct
must be extremely gross. The justification of this strictness is
that the independence of courts is an accepted canon of decent
government, and the law [i.e., international law] therefore does
not hold a state responsible for their faults. It follows than an
allegation of a denial of justice is a serious step which states,
as mentioned above, are reluctant to take when a claim can be

based on other grounds [i.e. an international claim in support

of its aggrieved national].”°?
The Tribunal does not find, on the evidence adduced in this arbitration, extremely
gross misconduct by the Respondent’s judiciary; and, hence, it decides that the

Claimants’ allegation of denial of justice is unproven.

266. Therefore, the Tribunal dismisses all claims by the Claimants in this regard on the
following ground: for the majority, for want of sufficient evidence to discharge the

Claimants’ burden of proof, and for the minority for lack of any such evidence.?>

267. All issues relating to heads of damages, quantification of damages, and other like

matters will be considered by the Tribunal in the next phase of the proceedings.

IX. THE OPERATIVE PART

268. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

qd)

Q)

Jurisdiction Over the Claimants’ Claims and Respondent’s Counterclaim

The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims under both the
BIT and the ICSID Convention, and decides by majority that the

Claimants’ case is admissible.

By majority: The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Respondent’s

counterclaim under the BIT.

Merits of the Claimants’ Claims

By majority: Article 2(3) BIT: By its failure to restructure the
Company’s Debt, the Respondent committed a breach of the fair and
equitable treatment standard under Article 2(3) of the BIT. The

Tribunal therefore must a:

 

s the compensation for the breach of

Article 2(3) in the next phase of this arbitration.

By majority: Article 4(1) and 4(2) BIT: The Respondent’s acts and
omissions following the Government’s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May
1999 constituted an expropriation in breach of Articles 4(1) and (2) of
the BIT. The Tribunal further decides that the Respondent breached
Article 4(2)(c) of the BIT, which requires an appropriate procedure to
determine the amount and method of payment of compensation in case

of expropriation. The Tribunal therefore must ass

 

compensation for

breach of Article 4 in the next phase of this arbitration.

Article 2(5) BIT: The Claimants have not proved that the Respondent,
through its judiciary, failed to provide the Claimants with effective
means to assert their claims and enforce their rights. Therefore the

Respondent is not liable for breach of Article 2(5) of the BIT and

 

Claimants’ claims in this regard (including denial of justice) are

dismissed.

93

(3) Damages and Costs: All issues relating to compensation and related matters
(including interest and allocation of costs) will be considered by the Tribunal

in the next phase of this arbitration.

(4) Save as ordered above, all other claims made by the Parties in this arbitration

are dismissed.

A dissenting opinion by arbitrator Mauro Rubino-Sammartano is attached hereto.
