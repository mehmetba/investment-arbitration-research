INTRODUCTION

This is an Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility in two arbitrations conducted pursuant
to Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), and the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976

(the “UNCITRAL Rules”).

The first arbitration was commenced by a Notice dated 10 December 2008 (the “Sertraline

Claim”).

The second arbitration was commenced by a Notice dated 4 June 2009 (the “Pravastatin

Claim”).

By agreement of the Parties, the jurisdiction / admissibility phase in each arbitration has
been held concurrently, albeit not consolidated, and determinations on these preliminary

issues in both arbitrations are set out in this single Award.

THE PARTIES

The Claimant: The Claimant in both arbitrations is Apotex, Inc. (““Apotex” or the
“Claimant”), a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Canada, with its

principal place of business at 150 Signet Drive, Weston, Ontario, Canada M91 1T9.

The Respondent: The Respondent in both arbitrations is the Government of the
United States of America (the “USA” or the “Respondent”), represented by its
Department of State.

The Claimant and the Respondent are referred to collectively as “the Parties”.

Page 7 of 120

(B) | THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS

8. Both arbitrations have been conducted pursuant to Section B of Chapter 11 of NAFTA, and
specifically Articles 1116, 1120 and 1122, which provide as follows:

“Article 1116: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf

1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a
claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or

(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the
monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations
under Section A,

and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out
of, that breach.

2. An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed
from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first
acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor
has incurred loss or damage.”

“Article 1120: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration

1. Except as provided in Annex 1120.1, and provided that six months have
elapsed since the events giving rise to a claim, a disputing investor may
submit the claim to arbitration under:

(a) the ICSID Convention, provided that both the disputing Party and the
Party of the investor are parties to the Convention;

(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, provided that either the
disputing Party or the Party of the investor, but not both, is a party to the
ICSID Convention; or

(c) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

2. The applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration except to the
extent modified by this Section.”

“Article 1122: Consent to Arbitration

1. Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in
accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement.

2. The consent given by paragraph | and the submission by a disputing
investor of a claim to arbitration shall satisfy the requirement of:

(a) Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and the
Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties;

(b) Article II of the New York Convention for an agreement in writing; and

(c) Article I of the Inter-American Convention for an agreement.”

Apotex’s consent to arbitration, pursuant to Article 1121 of NAFTA, and in accordance
with the procedures set out in NAFTA, is recorded in each of its two Notices of
Arbitration. Concurrently with the filing of each of its Notices of Arbitration, Apotex

submitted an executed waiver in the form required by NAFTA Article 1121.

Subject to its jurisdictional / admissibility objections, the Respondent has consented to

arbitration by virtue of Article 1122 of NAFTA.

In each arbitration, Apotex has elected to proceed under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
(1976), as is its option under NAFTA Article 1120.

GENERAL NATURE OF THE DISPUTE

Apotex develops and manufactures generic drugs, including solid oral dosage forms such
as capsules and tablets. Generic drugs are usually non-patented (and often less expensive)
versions of brand-name pioneer drugs that are, may be, or were previously protected by

patents.

Apotex’s activities in this regard include, in particular, the design and formulation of

proposed drug products; the procuring or manufacturing of active pharmaceutical

Page 9 of 120

(0)

ingredients; the preparation and filing of applications with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”); the seeking of approval to market and sell its drug products in

the United States; and the manufacture of the finished drug products.

Both of Apotex’s claims relate to the treatment said to have been accorded it by the USA,
its agencies and Federal Courts, in the course of its efforts to bring new generic drugs to

market in the United States.

The Sertraline Claim arises out of three decisions of the US Federal Courts in relation to
Apotex’s application seeking FDA approval for a generic version of a drug manufactured

by Pfizer Inc., called “Zoloft

By pes . : .
, which is used to treat depression; obsessive-compulsive

disorders; panic attacks; and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The Pravastatin Claim arises out of a decision of the FDA, and three decisions of the US
Federal Courts, in relation to Apotex’s new drug application seeking FDA approval for a
generic version of a drug manufactured by Bristol Myers Squibb, called “Pravachol””,

which is commonly used for lowering cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease.

In each case, Apotex alleges that the USA has breached its obligations under Section A of
Chapter 11 of the NAFTA, including: (i) Article 1102 — National Treatment; (ii) Article

1105 — Minimum Standard of Treatment; and (iii) Article 1110 — Expropriation.
NATURE OF THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

This Award addresses three preliminary objections that have been raised by the
Respondent. The first objection (whether there was an “investment” and an “investor”
within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven) applies to both arbitrations. The second
objection (whether the judicial acts complained of were “final”) and the third objection (the

NAFTA time bar) apply only to the Pravastatin Claim.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS

The Sertraline Claim: On or about 21 September 2007, Apotex served a Notice of
Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration upon the USA, in accordance with NAFTA Article
1119.

This was followed, on 10 December 2008, by a Notice of Arbitration, served pursuant to
Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Rules, and NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1120. This Notice was
received by the USA on 11 December 2008.

The Pravastatin Claim: On or about 2 March 2009, Apotex served a second Notice
of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration upon the USA, in accordance with NAFTA
Article 1119.

This was followed, on 4 June 2009, by a second Notice of Arbitration, served pursuant to
Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Rules, and NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1120. This Notice was
received by the USA on 5 June 2009.

Application for a Stay / Co-Ordination of Proceedings: On 29 October 2010,
Apotex submitted a Submission in Support of a Stay of the proceedings in relation to the
Notice of Arbitration of 4 June 2009 pending the resolution of its first Notice of Arbitration

by the Tribunal.

On 12 November 2010, the USA filed a Submission in Opposition to a Stay.

By subsequent agreement of the Parties, Apotex’s application to stay its Notice of
Arbitration dated 4 June 2009 was withdrawn, without waiving its right to reintroduce the

same after resolution of the Respondent’s preliminary objections.

CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1123, the Arbitral Tribunal comprises three arbitrators, with
one arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing Parties and the third, presiding arbitrator,
appointed by agreement of the disputing Parties.

On 23 October 2009, Apotex appointed Mr. Clifford M. Davidson, and on 20 August 2009,
the USA appointed The Honorable Fern M. Smith. The Parties agreed to appoint Mr. Toby
T. Landau QC as Presiding Arbitrator, and the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed constituted as
of 17 July 2010. A declaration of independence and impartiality pursuant to Article 9 of
the UNCITRAL Rules was duly completed by each Member of the Tribunal.

FIRST PROCEDURAL MEETING

The Parties agreed on certain initial procedural matters, as reflected in a joint letter of 10
August 2010 addressed to the Members of the Tribunal. The agreement included that the
Secretariat of ICSID render full administrative services in relation to the arbitration similar
to those rendered in arbitrations under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and that the

cost of ICSID’s services be included in the costs of the arbitration.

A first procedural meeting was convened in Washington, D.C. on 30 November 2010.

At the procedural meeting, the Parties confirmed that the Arbitral Tribunal had been duly
constituted in accordance with NAFTA Article 1123. They also agreed that the place of

arbitration (seat) would be New York, NY, USA, but that the hearings would be held in
Washington, D.C.

It was also agreed that, until resolution of the Respondent’s preliminary objections, and
without prejudice to any future application, the two claims would be heard concurrently,

but not consolidated.

The Parties agreed on a timetable for the exchange of written submissions.

It was also agreed that Ms. Aurélia Antonietti, Senior Counsel, ICSID, be appointed as

Secretary to the Tribunal.

On 16 December 2010, the ICSID Secretariat issued a detailed Procedural Order No. 1,

on instructions from the Arbitral Tribunal.

‘WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS

In accordance with paragraphs 62 of Procedural Order No. 1, Apotex submitted its
Statements of Claims in both arbitrations (pursuant to Art 18 of the UNCITRAL Rules) on
17 January 2011, and the USA submitted its Statement of Defense in both arbitrations
(pursuant to Art 19 of the UNCITRAL Rules) on 15 March 2011.

Thereafter, as directed by Procedural Order No 1, and pursuant to Art. 21 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, the USA filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction with respect
to both claims on 16 May 2011; on 1 August 2011, Apotex filed a Counter-Memorial on
Objections to Jurisdiction; on 17 October 2011, the USA filed a Reply on Objections to
Jurisdiction, and on 16 December 2011, Apotex filed a Rejoinder on Objections to

Jurisdiction.

PARTICIPATION OF NON-DISPUTING PARTIES

Section XV of Procedural Order No. 1 provided that:

“The parties agree that the Arbitral Tribunal shall consider any application
for leave to file a submission in this arbitration by an intending amicus, and
any notice by a non-party pursuant to Article 1128 of the NAFTA, taking

Page 14 of 120

43.

into account the recommendations of the FTC on non-disputing party
participation, issued on 7 October 2003.

The parties shall have the opportunity to make submissions on any
application for leave to file a submission in this arbitration by an intending
amicus and any notice by a non-party.

The Arbitral Tribunal shall issue a ruling on any amicus application for
leave to file a submission, taking into account the recommendations of the
FTC on amicus participation.”

On 25 August 2011, the Centre received an “Application For Leave To File A Non-
Disputing Party Submission” filed by the Study Centre for Sustainable Finance, “the
research and development arm of the Business Neatness Magnanimity BNM srl”, a per
profit non-governmental organisation incorporated in Rome, Italy. Attached to the

application was a “Statement of Non-Disputing Party”.

After having heard both Parties, on 15 September 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties
of its decision to refuse the application, on the basis that the proposed amicus brief did not
satisfy the relevant criteria as set out in the Statement of the Free Trade Commission on
Non-Disputing Party Participation of 7 October 2003. The applicant was also informed of

the Tribunal’s decision.

The reasoning of the Tribunal was set out in detail in its Procedural Order No. 2 dated 11

October 2012.

HEARING ON PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

As agreed at the first procedural meeting, the Parties and the President of the Tribunal held

a pre-hearing conference by telephone on 24 January 2012.
The hearing on preliminary objections took place at the World Bank offices in

Washington, D.C., from 15 February 2012 to 16 February 2012. The hearing was open to

the public, although some limited business information was treated as confidential at

Apotex’s request, and the hearing moved into closed session for a short while on the first

day to accommodate this.

Apotex was represented at the hearing by Mr. William A. Rakoczy; Ms. Lara Fitzsimmons;
and Mr. Robert M. Teigen, all of Rakoczy Molino Mazzochi Siwik, LLP. The Respondent
was represented at the hearing by Ms. Mary Mcleod (Principal Deputy Legal Adviser); Mr.
Jeffrey D. Kovar (Assistant Legal Adviser); Mr. Jeremy Sharpe; Mr. Neale H. Bergman;
Mr. David M. Bigge; Mr. Patrick W. Pearsall; Ms. Abby L. Lounsberry; and Ms. Karin
Kizer (Attorney-Advisers, Office of International Claims and Investment Disputes, Office
of the Legal Adviser). Mr. Salvador Behar and Ms. Joanna Holguin appeared on behalf of
the Government of Mexico, and Ms. Megan Clifford and Ms. Fatima Nakhuda appeared on
behalf of the Government of Canada. The Tribunal was assisted by its Secretary, Ms.

Aurélia Antonietti.

At the conclusion of the oral hearing, each Party confirmed:

(a) that the requirements of the UNCITRAL Rules had been met, and that it had been

given a full opportunity of presenting its case; and

(b) that the hearing was to be declared closed for the purposes of Article 29(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules.

Following the hearing, each Party submitted suggested corrections to the transcript, and a

finalised version was then circulated.

POST-HEARING SUBMISSIONS

By agreement of the Parties, as recorded at the end of the oral hearing, and subsequently

embodied in Procedural Order No. 3, dated 17 February 2012:

(a) there were no post-hearing briefs;

RELEVANT U.S. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

INTRODUCTION

This section describes the U.S. statutory background that gives rise to each of Apotex’s

claims.

GENERAL STATUTORY BACKGROUND

In the United States, the approval of new and generic drugs is governed by the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq., as amended by:

(a) the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, Pub. L. No.
98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (1984) (commonly known as the “Hatch-Waxman

Amendments” or “Hatch-Waxman”); and

(b) the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003,
Pub. L. No. 108-173, 117 Stat. 2066 (2003) (“MMA’).!

New Drug Applications: Under the FFDCA, a company that seeks to sell a new or
previously unapproved drug must file a “New Drug Application” (“NDA”) with the FDA.

NDAs are very substantial filings. They must include, inter alia, technical data on the
composition of the drug; the means for manufacturing it; clinical trial results establishing
its safety and effectiveness; and labelling describing the use for which approval is

requested (21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1)).

' The MMA also amended Title 35 of the U.S. Code, which governs patents more generally, specifically 35 U.S.C.
§ 271 (“Section 271”).

Generic Drug Applications / ANDAs: Before the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Amendments,
a generic drug company was obliged to wait until the patent protecting a drug product
expired, before it could begin the lengthy process of preparing its application for
submission to the FDA. Because such testing often takes years, the brand company
continued to monopolise the particular drug market years after patent expiration, for the
time it took the generic drug company to complete the necessary tests and for the FDA to
issue its approval. This unintended period of extended market exclusivity constituted, in

effect, a de facto extension of the patent term.

Additionally, prior to 1984, a company seeking to market a generic version of an FDA
approved drug had to complete expensive and time-consuming safety and efficacy studies
on the drug, even though the NDA-holder had already established the drug’s safety and

efficacy through its own studies.

By the Hatch-Waxman and MMA amendments to the FFDCA, the US Congress simplified
the procedure for obtaining approval of lower-priced generic drugs. An abbreviated
approval process was introduced, that enables generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to
obtain regulatory approval of generic versions of previously-approved NDA drugs on an
expedited basis. The process is now a streamlined version of the full NDA procedure, and
results in a generic drug product that is normally marketed under the chemical name of the

active drug ingredient.
The amendments permit a generic drug company to file an “Abbreviated New Drug
Application” (“ANDA”), which relies on information contained in the NDA, instead of

repeating the same comprehensive, extensive clinical studies of safety and efficacy.

The purpose of the ANDA process is to:

Page 19 of 120

59.

60.

61.

62.

“strike a balance between incentives, on the one hand, for innovation, and
on the other, for quickly getting lower-cost generic drugs to market.”

An applicant submitting an ANDA is required to establish, among other matters, that its
proposed generic product is bio-equivalent to the already-approved NDA drug, and that it
has the same active ingredient, dosage form, dosage strength, route of administration, and

labelling (with certain exceptions) (21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)).

In addition to creating a simplified regulatory approval pathway, the Hatch-Waxman
Amendments also created a special, expedited mechanism for resolving patent disputes,
before a generic drug is commercialised. To this end, as part of its NDA, a brand company

is required to submit information regarding each patent that:

“claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application or which
claims a method of using such drug and with respect to which a claim of
patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by
the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug.”

(21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1); § 355(c)(2)).

The FDA publishes patent information submitted by NDA-holders in the Patent and
Exclusivity Information Addendum of its publication, Approved Drug Products with

Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the “Orange Book”).

By submitting a patent for listing in the Orange Book, the NDA-holder necessarily puts all
prospective generic ANDA applicants on notice that a suit for infringement could be
asserted against any ANDA applicant that attempts to seek approval for and market a

generic version of the NDA drug.

? Teva Pharms. Indus. v. Crawford, 410 F.3d 51, 54 (D.C. Cir. 2005) [R68]; see also H.R. Rep. No. 98-857 pt. | at
30 (Judiciary Committee), noting that the goal of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments was to “balance the need to
stimulate innovation against the goal of furthering the public interest” [R43].

An ANDA applicant is required, inter alia, to address each patent listed in the Orange
Book in connection with the approved NDA drug. Specifically, the ANDA must include a
so-called “certification” to any properly-listed Orange Book patents (21 U.S.C.
§ 355(j)(2AV(Vii)).

The statute provides four certification options, two of which are relevant in this case:

(a) the so-called “paragraph III” certification, where the applicant certifies that it
will not market until after the listed patent has expired (21 U.S.C. §
355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IID); and

(b) the so-called “paragraph IV” certification, where the applicant seeks immediate
approval because the listed patent is invalid and/or not infringed by the proposed
ANDA product, or otherwise not enforceable against the generic manufacturer

(21 U.S.C. § 355()(2)(A)(vii)(IV)).>

Paragraph IV Certification: A paragraph IV certification allows an ANDA
applicant to seek approval prior to patent expiration. In so doing, it must notify the
patentee and NDA-holder of the factual and legal bases for the certification, and in
particular why, in the ANDA applicant’s view, the patent is invalid, not infringed, or

unenforceable (21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(B)).
The submission of a paragraph IV certification has two important effects:
(a) First, as an incentive for generic companies to challenge brand patents, Congress

granted the first company to file a paragraph IV ANDA, in limited circumstances,

a 180-day period of generic market exclusivity, during which time the FDA will

> The other certification options are: paragraph I, where the applicant certifies that no patent information has been
filed, and paragraph II, where the applicant certifies that the patent has expired.

Page 21 of 120

(b)

not approve other ANDAs (21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)). This exclusivity is

triggered by the earlier of two events:

i. the first-filer’s commercial marketing of the generic drug; or

ii. “a decision of a court . . . holding the patent which is subject of the
certification to be invalid or not infringed” - the so-called “court decision

trigger” (21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) (2002).*

It is Apotex’s case that the court decision trigger includes any decision of non-
infringement by, or invalidity with respect to, any filer in any action. In
particular, that Congress intended for a court decision to trigger the first-filer’s
exclusivity even if the latter was not in a position to benefit from it (citing e.g.,
Teva Pharms., USA, Inc. v. FDA, 182 F.3d 1003, 1009-11 (D.C. Cir. 1999)).
Further, by including the court decision trigger, Congress sought to ensure that the
180-day exclusivity period did not indefinitely delay generic competition from

subsequent ANDA-filers.

Second, the submission of a paragraph IV certification for a listed patent
constitutes an act of infringement that creates the necessary case or controversy
and subject-matter jurisdiction to enable a US District Court to resolve any
dispute concerning infringement or validity of the patent, prior to the actual
launch and commercialisation of the generic drug product (35 U.S.C.

§ 271(@)2)(A)).

New History and Discussion of 180-Day Exclusivity, 64 Food & Drug L. J. 335, 349-358 (2009).

Citations to 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) refer to Hatch-Waxman as it existed prior to the passage of the MMA,
which amended, among others, the exclusivity provisions of the statute. The changes to the 180-day exclusivity
period that were implemented by the MMA were prospective only, and do not apply to either of the Sertraline or
Pravastatin ANDAs, both of which were filed before 8 December 2003.

Certifications Under Multiple Paragraphs: _ANDA applicants may include both
paragraph III and paragraph IV certifications in one application to market a new generic
drug. If this occurs, the validity period of a patent that is the subject of a paragraph III
certification can influence market timing related to a patent that is the subject of a

paragraph IV certification.

For example, ANDA applicants may admit that one of the patents listed in the Orange
Book for a pioneer drug is valid, enforceable, and unexpired, and thus subject to paragraph
Ill certification, whilst also arguing that other patents related to the same drug, such as a
particular formulation of the drug or the use of a drug for treating a particular disease, are

invalid, not infringed, or unenforceable, and thus subject to paragraph IV certification.

Where an ANDA applicant includes both a paragraph III and a paragraph IV certification,
the applicant must wait until the patent subject to the paragraph III certification expires

before its ANDA is approved.

A later applicant, which was not the first to make a paragraph IV certification, and which is
therefore not eligible for 180-day exclusivity, may seek to trigger the start of the 180-day
exclusivity period before the first applicant can bring its product to market. In other words,
the later-in-time applicant may, in such circumstances, seek to eliminate or shorten the
180-day exclusivity period by causing the 180 days to run while all of the ANDA
applicants, including the ANDA applicant eligible for exclusivity, wait for the patent
subject to the paragraph III certification to expire before they may get FDA approval to

market their respective drugs.

RELEVANT STATUTORY BACKGROUND TO THE SERTRALINE CLAIM

Apotex’s Sertraline Claim involves statutory provisions governing an ANDA applicant’s
ability to file and maintain a declaratory judgment action for patent non-infringement,

invalidity, and/or unenforceability.

Page 23 of 120

75.

As a means of safeguarding brand companies, Hatch-Waxman prohibits the FDA from
approving a paragraph IV ANDA for 30 months, if the brand company brings suit within
45 days of learning of the paragraph IV filing (21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)).

However, under the MMA, if the NDA-holder/patent owner does not file such a suit within
the 45-day period, the statute allows an ANDA applicant to file and maintain a suit for a
declaratory judgment against the NDA-holder/patent owner, both to obtain patent certainty
and to remove any barriers to approval, such as another applicant’s 180-day exclusivity.

Specifically, this applies if:

(a) the 45-day period has passed since notice of the paragraph IV certification was
received;
(b) neither the patent owner nor the NDA-holder has brought an action for

infringement of the patent within the 45-day period; and

(c) the NDA-holder/patent owner has been granted an Offer of Confidential Access to
the ANDA

(21 U.S.C. §§ 355()(5)(C)((A)(aa-ce).

Once these three conditions are met, the MMA provides that an ANDA applicant:

“may, in accordance with section 2201 of Title 28 [i.e. the Declaratory
Judgment Act], bring a civil action under such section against the owner or
holder referred to in such subclause . . . for a declaratory judgment that the
patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the drug for which the applicant
seeks approval .. .”

(21 U.S.C. § 355G)(5\(C\@AD).

According to the MMA, in such circumstances:

Page 24 of 120

“the courts of the United States shall, to the extent consistent with the
Constitution, have subject matter jurisdiction in any action brought by such
person under section 2201 of Title 28 for a declaratory judgment that such
patent is invalid or not infringed.”

(35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(5)).

76. As emphasised by Apotex, Congress enacted these declaratory judgment provisions, inter
alia, to:
“ensure that the 180-day exclusivity period enjoyed by the first generic to

challenge a patent cannot be used as a bottleneck to prevent additional
generic competition.”

(149 Cong. Rec. $15,746 (24 Nov. 2003)).

Congress was concerned that:

“when generic applicants are blocked by a first generic applicant’s 180-day
exclusivity, the brand drug company could choose not to sue those other
generic applicants so as to delay a final court decision that could trigger the
‘failure to market’ provision and force the first generic to market.”

And Congress expected that:

“in almost all situations where a generic applicant has . . . not been sued for
patent infringement, a claim by the generic applicant seeking declaratory
judgment on the patent will give rise to a justiciable ‘case or controversy’
under the Constitution.”

(149 Cong. Rec. $15,885 (25 Nov. 2003).
77. The Respondent, on the other hand, emphasises that the Declaratory Judgment Act

specifies that courts have jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment “in a case of actual

controversy,”* which (according to the Respondent) is generally understood as a reference

528 U.S.C. § 2201 provides:

Page 25 of 120

to the “case or controversy” requirement for jurisdiction in the federal courts under Article
Ill of the U.S. Constitution. 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(5) (“Section 271”), which governs patents
generally, states that Federal Courts have subject matter jurisdiction over declaratory
judgment actions brought by ANDA applicants “to the extent consistent with the
Constitution.”° Under the U.S. Constitution, the power of the federal courts is limited to
“cases” and to “controversies” arising under federal law (U.S. Const. art. III, § 2). On the
Respondent’s analysis, therefore, an ANDA applicant that wishes to bring a declaratory
judgment action under Section 355, Section 271 and the Declaratory Judgment Act must

meet the “case or controversy” requirement of Article III of the U.S. Constitution.

(D) | RELEVANT STATUTORY BACKGROUND TO THE PRAVASTATIN CLAIM

78. Apotex’s Pravastatin Claim concerns the statutory “court-decision trigger” for the 180-day

generic exclusivity.

79. According to Apotex, US Courts have interpreted this trigger broadly. In particular,
Apotex submits that the trigger includes any court decision on the patent that is the subject
of the paragraph IV certification, regardless of whether the first-filer is involved in that
particular litigation (citing e.g., Granutec, Inc. v. Shalala, 139 F.3d 889, 1998 WL
153410, at *5, *10 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 1998), and Teva, 182 F.3d at 1005 n.3, both of which

 

“In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, except with respect to Federal taxes . . .
any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights
and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further
relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final
judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.”

° The provision, in full, is as follows:

“Where a person has filed an application described in paragraph (2) that includes a certification
under subsection (b)(2)(A)(iv) or (i) (2)(A)(vii)(IV) of section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. § 355), and neither the owner of the patent that is the subject of the
certification nor the holder of the approved application under subsection (b) of such section for
the drug that is claimed by the patent or a use of which is claimed by the patent brought an action
for infringement of such patent before the expiration of 45 days after the date on which the notice
given under subsection (b)(3) or (j)(2)(B) of such section was received, the courts of the United
States shall, to the extent consistent with the Constitution, have subject matter jurisdiction in any
action brought by such person under section 2201 of title 28 for a declaratory judgment that such
patent is invalid or not infringed.”

 

Page 26 of 120

held that exclusivity had been triggered by a court decision involving a subsequent

applicant).

According to Apotex, this trigger also encompasses a broad spectrum of decisions,
including decisions of patent unenforceability, despite the absence of this ground in the
express language of the statute, and the grant of partial summary judgment based on the
patentee’s admission of non-infringement (citing e.g., Teva, 182 F.3d at 1009; 21 C.F.R.
§ 314.107(c)(1)(ii); Granutec, 1998 WL 153410, at *5, *8 n.2).

Additionally, Apotex points to the finding in Teva (supra) that the dismissal of a
declaratory judgment action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction can constitute a “court
decision” for the purposes of triggering generic exclusivity, if the dismissal estops the
patentee from subsequently asserting that the ANDA product infringes the patent-in-suit
(the Court holding that: “/t/o start, or trigger, the period of market exclusivity by a ‘court
decision,’ an ANDA applicant need only obtain a judgment that has the effect of rendering

the patent invalid or not infringed with respect to itself’).

OUTLINE OF APOTEX’S CLAIMS

INTRODUCTION

This section provides an outline of the nature of Apotex’s claims against the USA, as set
out in its various pleadings and submissions. This is simply by way of broad context for
the jurisdiction and admissibility issues analysed in Section V below, and without any

findings or conclusions by the Tribunal.

It is to be noted that each of Apotex’s claims is denied by the USA, which asserts that there
has been no violation of NAFTA Chapter 11, and which has set out a detailed defence on
each issue. Since this Award deals only with issues of jurisdiction and admissibility,

however, there is no need to elaborate on the USA’s position on the merits.
THE SERTRALINE CLAIM

On 27 October 2003, Apotex submitted an ANDA seeking FDA approval for a generic
version of Pfizer Inc.’s popular anti-depressant medication, Zoloft”, known generically as
sertraline hydrochloride. Apotex states that it invested more than fC in
formulating and developing a generic version of this drug, in the form of tablets in 25 mg,
50 mg, and 100 mg strengths.’ As part of its generic drug application, Apotex was
statutorily required to address and certify to any patents listed by Pfizer as purporting to

claim the approved use of Zoloft® Tablets, or the approved product itself.

Pfizer submitted information on several patents to the FDA for listing in the Orange Book

in connection with Zoloft”, including U.S. Patent Nos. 4,356,518 (the “*518 patent”) and

7 Witness Statement of Bernice Tao, para. 15 [C39].

5,248,699 (the “*699 patent”). On Apotex’s case, by listing these patents, Pfizer
affirmatively represented that a suit for infringement could reasonably be asserted against
any generic manufacturer (such as Apotex) that attempted to market a generic sertraline

product prior to the expiration of these patents.

Another generic company and competitor, Ivax Corporation (“Ivax”), was the first
applicant to file an ANDA for generic sertraline containing a paragraph IV certification to
a listed patent (the ‘699 patent). This was done in 1999,* and made Ivax eligible for 180-
day exclusivity, which would be triggered by the earlier of (i) first commercial marketing

or (ii) a favourable Court decision.

Further, Ivax’s ANDA filing was an act of infringement that created the necessary subject-
matter jurisdiction for Pfizer to sue Ivax for infringement of the ‘699 patent. This Pfizer

did in January 2000.

Ivax submitted a paragraph III certification to the ‘518 patent, indicating that it would not

seek approval until that patent expired in June 2006.

In May 2002, Pfizer and Ivax settled their litigation, with Ivax effectively conceding
validity and infringement of the ‘699 patent, in exchange for a royalty-bearing licence.
The settlement thus preserved Ivax’s exclusivity and, consequently, acted to block

approval of all other sertraline ANDAs, including Apotex’s ANDA.

In the same way as Ivax, Apotex also filed a paragraph IV certification to the ‘699 patent,

and a paragraph III certification to the ‘518 patent. This was done on 27 October 2003.°

Apotex’s submission of a paragraph IV certification constituted an act of infringement

sufficient to create subject-matter jurisdiction to resolve any questions regarding the

* See Apotex Inc. & Apotex Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., 385 F. Supp. 2d 187, 190 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) [R16].

95.

infringement and validity of the ‘699 patent. But, instead of filing suit against Apotex, as it
did with Ivax, Apotex claims that Pfizer intentionally delayed suing it (and all other
sertraline ANDA filers) so as to avoid a triggering court decision, which would trigger

Ivax’s exclusivity and relieve the “bottleneck” in the market.

Given Pfizer’s strategy, Apotex filed an action for a declaratory judgment against Pfizer on
1 April 2004 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
pursuant to the MMA. According to Apotex, this suit was the only way for it to obtain

patent certainty and immediate approval of its product in 2006.

Pfizer moved to dismiss Apotex’s suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

On 30 December 2004, the District Court granted Pfizer’s motion, and dismissed Apotex’s
action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on the ground that Apotex did not have a
“reasonable apprehension” that it would be sued by Pfizer over its generic sertraline
ANDA."° The District Court specifically rejected Apotex’s argument that application of
the Federal Circuit’s “reasonable apprehension” standard was unlawful because it
conflicts with controlling Supreme Court precedent, and that the MMA required that the
Court:

“employ the Article III case or controversy analysis applied in non-patent
cases and in patent cases involving allegations of actual (as opposed to
potential) infringement, requiring that ‘there is (1) an actual or imminent
injury-in-fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant, and (3) is
redressible by a favorable decision.”

(id. at 192 (citations omitted)).
Applying this test, Apotex had argued that there was subject-matter jurisdiction because

Pfizer had listed the ‘699 patent, thus asserting that a claim of patent infringement could

reasonably be asserted against any unlicensed generic ANDA-filer like Apotex; that

1° Apotex, Inc. v. Pfizer Inc., 385 F. Supp. 2d 187, 192-94 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).

Page 30 of 120

96.

97.

98.

Apotex had challenged the ‘699 patent in its ANDA, thereby subjecting itself to suit; that
Apotex was at risk of substantial financial losses having spent considerable sums preparing
and filing its ANDA—an investment that could be lost if Pfizer were to mount a successful
infringement action; that such losses would be even more substantial if Apotex’s sertraline
products were found to infringe the patent after Apotex had launched its products; and that,
absent a declaratory judgment, Apotex could be delayed from obtaining final FDA
approval indefinitely, and at the very least by 180 days after Ivax’s marketing of its own

sertraline products.

As set out in detail in its Statement of Claims, it is Apotex’s case that the District Court
erred as a matter of law in failing to find subject-matter jurisdiction over Apotex’s claims
for declaratory relief, and proceeded on a basis that (1) ignored the MMA; (2) failed to
consider whether Apotex satisfied the actual controversy requirement of Article III of the
U.S. Constitution, regardless of any reasonable apprehension of suit;'' (3) in any event
misapplied the Federal Circuit’s reasonable apprehension test; and (4) misapplied

controlling Supreme Court precedent regarding Article III of the U.S. Constitution.

Apotex appealed this decision to the Federal Circuit. On 12 December 2005, the Federal

Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of Apotex’s suit, without opinion. ’?

Apotex then submitted a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme
Court, seeking review of the Federal Circuit’s decision. On 10 October 2006, the Supreme

Court denied Apotex’s petition, without comment.'?

'' In particular, Apotex states the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit have both since acknowledged that the
controlling test is the case or controversy standard under Article III of the Constitution, which the New York District
Court refused to apply. Apotex cites, inter alia, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 127 S.Ct. 764, 771 (2007)
for the proposition that the reasonable apprehension test for subject matter jurisdiction is not and has never been the
proper test.

102.

103.

By way of broad outline only, it is the Respondent’s case that, at the time, the “reasonable
apprehension of suit” standard as applied by the District Court had been applied in
hundreds of cases by Federal Courts throughout the U.S. over the course of several decades

in declaratory judgment actions involving intellectual property.

In the course of its pleading, Apotex, on the other hand, has applied a variety of epithets to
the conduct of each of these Courts, including “unlawful”; “wrongful”; “improper”;

“arbitrary”; “capricious”; and “unjust”.
At the core of Apotex’s complaint is the assertion that the Courts permitted and enabled
Pfizer to continue to “bottleneck” the generic market, and delay approval of Apotex’s

ANDA.

Further, because the decisions by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York, the Federal Circuit, and the Supreme Court prevented Apotex from obtaining a
declaratory judgment of patent non-infringement or invalidity, Apotex was unable to bring
its generic sertraline products to the US market promptly, causing Apotex (on its case)
substantial damages. More specifically, because these Courts refused to hear Apotex’s
declaratory judgment action, Apotex was unable to obtain the Court decision necessary to
trigger Ivax’s generic exclusivity period prior to the expiration of the ‘518 patent. As a
result, Ivax launched its generic sertraline products with exclusivity, thereby obtaining—at
Apotex’s expense—the majority of the generic sertraline market share and a financial

windfall by virtue of offering the sole generic alternative to Pfizer’s Zoloft” tablets.

It is Apotex’s case, in broad summary, that in preventing it from obtaining a declaratory
judgment of patent non-infringement or invalidity, which in turn prevented it from
promptly bringing its generic sertraline products to the U.S. market, the USA, through its

Federal Courts, has:

(a) acted in breach of its National Treatment obligations under NAFTA Article 1102;

Page 32 of 120

104.

©

105.

106.

107.

(b) acted in breach of its obligation to accord Apotex’s investments fair and equitable
treatment, and to meet the minimum standard of treatment under international law,

under NAFTA Article 1105 (including an alleged denial of justice);

(c) interfered with and expropriated Apotex’s property rights in its ANDA for generic
sertraline tablets, in violation of NAFTA Article 1110 (in particular, by
unlawfully redistributing the financial benefits of Apotex’s investment to the
patentee and another sertraline ANDA filer, and by preventing Apotex from
obtaining final approval of its generic sertraline tablets immediately upon

expiration of the ‘518 patent).

Apotex claims that it has incurred significant loss and damage as a result of the USA’s
conduct, and claims declaratory and monetary relief (not less than US$ 8,000,000) in this

regard.

THE PRAVASTATIN CLAIM

Apotex’s Pravastatin Claim involves the prescription heart medication pravastatin sodium

tablets, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) under the brand-name Pravachol”.

On 21 December 2001, Apotex submitted an ANDA seeking FDA approval for a generic
version of Pravachol”. At the time Apotex filed its ANDA, BMS had submitted
information on four patents for listing in FDA’s Orange Book in connection with this drug:
USS. Patent Nos. 4,346,227 (the “*227 patent’); 5,030,447 (the “447 patent”); 5,180,589
(the “589 patent”); and 5,622,985 (the “*985 patent”).

On Apotex’s case, by listing these patents, BMS affirmatively represented that a suit for

infringement could reasonably be asserted against any generic pravastatin manufacturer,

including Apotex.

Page 33 of 120

108.

109.

110.

111.

112.

113.

114.

Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”) purportedly was the first generic applicant to
submit a paragraph IV ANDA for generic pravastatin tablets in 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg
strengths, and Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (“Ranbaxy”) was purportedly the first
generic applicant to submit a paragraph IV ANDA for these generic tablets in the 80 mg
strength. As a result, Teva and Ranbaxy were eligible for 180-day exclusivity for these

products.

Both Teva and Ranbaxy filed paragraph III certifications to the ‘227 patent, thus indicating
that neither would seek final FDA approval until this patent expired (on 20 April 2006).

BMS did not sue either company.

Apotex’s pravastatin sodium ANDA contained paragraph IV certifications to the ‘447,
“589, and ‘985 patents, and a paragraph III certification to the ‘227 patent. Consequently,
the FDA could not approve Apotex’s ANDA until 20 April 2006, when the ‘227 patent

expired.

As required under the statute, Apotex provided BMS with notice of its pravastatin sodium
ANDA and its paragraph IV certifications. However, BMS, without comment or
explanation, refrained from suing Apotex for infringement of the ‘447, ‘589 and ‘985

patents.

But the fact that BMS initially refused to sue Apotex did not mean that Apotex could
launch its products without fear from infringement liability. BMS still had the right and
ability to sue Apotex when Apotex launched its generic products. Thus, Apotex could not
market its products without fear of infringement liability and (on Apotex’s case)
significant, if not catastrophic, monetary damages—damages far exceeding Apotex’s

sales—and an injunction prohibiting future marketing.

In order to obtain patent certainty without Court intervention, Apotex repeatedly tried to

obtain assurances from BMS that it would not sue Apotex for infringement of the ‘447,

Page 34 of 120

115.

116.

117.

118.

“589, and ‘985 patents. When BMS would not sign a binding covenant not to sue Apotex
for infringement of these patents, Apotex filed a declaratory judgment action in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York in order to attempt to secure a
binding Court order that would provide a “perfected” preclusive effect, estopping BMS

from suing Apotex upon commercial launch of its generic product.

BMS moved to dismiss Apotex’s declaratory judgment action for lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction on the basis that Apotex lacked a “reasonable apprehension” of suit in light of
BMS’s binding representations, contained in filed Court papers and a sworn declaration,

that it would not sue Apotex for infringement of the ‘447, ‘589, and ‘985 patents.

Whilst the District Court did not rule on BMS’s motion, it ultimately entered an Order
dismissing Apotex’s declaratory judgment action based upon BMS’s binding
representations that it would not sue Apotex.'* The District Court’s dismissal order

became final and unappealable on 22 August 2004.

On 7 September 2004, Apotex wrote to the FDA, seeking confirmation that the dismissal
of its declaratory judgment action against BMS triggered any generic exclusivity that
would be awarded for pravastatin, such that Apotex’s own ANDA would be eligible for
full and final approval once the ‘227 patent expired in April 2006.

On 28 June 2005, the FDA responded to Apotex’s letter, confirming that exclusivity for all
strengths of pravastatin expired no later than 18 February 2005, having been triggered by
the dismissal of Apotex’s declaratory judgment action.'* The FDA further concluded that
Apotex’s pravastatin ANDA would be eligible for immediate final approval on 20 April
2006.

The FDA’s decision explicitly relied on controlling Federal Court decisions involving the
drug “ticlopidine” and the same filers as for pravastatin - Teva and Apotex - in which the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had found that the dismissal of
Teva’s declaratory judgment action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, based on the

patent holder’s disavowal of an intent to sue, constituted a triggering court decision.

After the FDA issued its pravastatin decision, Teva challenged the Agency’s ruling in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Teva argued that the BMS-Apotex
dismissal did not trigger the 180-day generic exclusivity period for pravastatin (i.e. it did
not qualify as a court decision trigger under Section 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(ID)), and sought a
preliminary injunction and judgment on the merits preventing Apotex and other generic

companies from marketing their products. Apotex intervened and opposed Teva’s motion.

On 21 October 2005, the District Court for the District of Columbia granted Teva’s

motion.‘

Apotex sought to stay the injunction pending an appeal but, on 8 December 2005, the
Court denied Apotex’s motion.'’ Thus, Apotex was prevented from both obtaining final
approval for, and marketing, its pravastatin product upon expiration of the ‘227 patent in

April 2006.

On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the
FDA’s 28 June 2005 decision was arbitrary and capricious, because the Agency had not
properly explained the reasoning behind its decision.'* Whilst the D.C. Circuit expressed

no opinion on what actually constitutes a triggering court decision under the statute, the

Court instructed the District Court to vacate the FDA’s 28 June 2005 decision, and remand

the matter to the Agency for further proceedings. The Court stated:

“[w]hile the statute may preclude treating voluntary dismissals (or, for that
matter [involuntary] dismissals . . . ) as triggering events, we express no
opinion on the matter. It is up to the agency to bring its expertise to bear in
light of competing interests at stake and make a reasonable policy choice.
The FDA has not yet done so.”

124. On 11 April 2006, the FDA issued its second administrative decision pertaining to the issue
of 180-day exclusivity for pravastatin sodium tablets.'? In that decision, the FDA reversed
itself and, contrary to its prior ticlopidine ruling, determined that the BMS-Apotex
dismissal was insufficient to trigger the 180-day exclusivity for pravastatin. The FDA
determined that only a decision of a court, holding on the merits that a particular patent is
invalid, not infringed, or unenforceable, would suffice to trigger the 180-day exclusivity
period, and that such holding must be evidenced by language on the face of the court’s

decision.

125. Apotex challenged this 11 April 2006 decision in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, moving for immediate injunctive relief setting aside the FDA’s administrative
ruling and enjoining it from awarding 180-day exclusivity for pravastatin. Apotex argued
that the FDA’s decision was contrary to Hatch-Waxman and the FFDCA, and conflicted

with controlling precedent from the D.C. Circuit in the ticlopidine line of cases.

126. On 19 April 2006, the District Court denied Apotex’s motion.”°

decision.

128. On 6 June 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed
the District Court’s order.”!

129. Apotex moved for rehearing en banc, which was denied on 17 August 2006. In light of the
D.C. Circuit’s order, and the fact that Teva’s exclusivity for pravastatin would expire
before Apotex’s suit could be resolved on the merits, Apotex voluntarily dismissed its
claim. It elected not to petition for a writ of certiorari for review by the U.S. Supreme
Court of the Court of Appeals’ ruling, and, rather than litigating the merits of its case after
losing its bid for preliminary injunctive relief, it stipulated to the dismissal of its claims
with prejudice for certain strengths of the drug, and without prejudice for another strength
(Apotex Inc. v. FDA, No. 06-627 (D.D.C. 3 Oct. 2006) (Dkt. No. 42, Stipulation of

Dismissal).

130. It is Apotex’s case that the decisions of the FDA, the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit were

“unlawful”, “unjust”, “improper”, “arbitrary” and “capricious”, and have each violated
U.S. statutory law and prior controlling precedent. In particular, it is alleged that the FDA
and the D.C. district and appellate courts: (1) adopted and applied an interpretation of the
FFDCA that squarely conflicts with and violates Congressional intent, the purpose behind
Hatch-Waxman, and controlling Federal Court precedent; (2) adopted and upheld a
statutory interpretation that runs counter to the FDA’s own regulation implementing the
statute in a non-textual manner, by permitting a court decision of unenforceability to
qualify as a court decision trigger; (3) construed the statute in a manner that nullifies and
renders inoperable the declaratory judgment mechanism under Hatch-Waxman; and (4)
failed to treat the BMS-Apotex dismissal in a manner similar to those court decisions
entered in similar cases, despite the fact that this dismissal supports estoppel to the same
extent as the Teva-Syntex dismissal, as well as the grant of partial summary judgment in

Granutec.

?! Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 1249, 1254 (D.C. Cir. 2006).

Page 38 of 120

131. According to Apotex, the FDA and the D.C. district and appellate courts’ refusals to deem
the dismissal of its declaratory judgment action against BMS as a trigger under the
FFDCA, meant that Apotex was unable to bring its generic pravastatin products to the
market promptly, and as soon as the ‘227 patent and its associated period of paediatric
exclusivity expired. This, so Apotex claims, caused it substantial damages. More
specifically, because there was a refusal to find that the 180-day exclusivity period for
generic pravastatin products had been triggered and expired, Teva and Ranbaxy launched
their generic pravastatin products with exclusivity, thus securing a strangle-hold over the

market.

132. It is Apotex’s case, in broad summary, that by reason of these matters, the USA, through
the FDA and its Federal Courts, has:

(a) acted in breach of its National Treatment obligations under NAFTA Article 1102;

(b) acted in breach of its obligation to accord Apotex’s investments fair and equitable
treatment, and to meet the minimum standard of treatment under international law,

under NAFTA Article 1105 (including an alleged denial of justice);

(c) interfered with and expropriated Apotex’s property rights in its ANDA for generic
pravastatin tablets, in violation of NAFTA Article 1110 (in particular, by
unlawfully redistributing the financial benefits of Apotex’s investment to other
pravastatin ANDA filers, and by preventing Apotex from obtaining final approval
of its generic pravastatin tablets immediately upon expiration of the ‘227 patent

and its corresponding period of paediatric exclusivity).
133. Apotex claims that it has incurred significant loss and damage as a result of the USA’s

conduct, and claims declaratory and monetary relief (not less than US$ 8,000,000) in this

regard.

Page 39 of 120

134. Again by way of broad outline only, it is the Respondent’s case that Apotex’s two claims
in this arbitration raise one core allegation, specifically, that Federal Courts in New York
and the District of Columbia, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the federal agency charged with
interpreting the relevant statute, made legal errors in applying U.S. federal law. Alongside
detailed responses to each of Apotex’s individual claims under the provisions of NAFTA
Chapter Eleven, the Respondent emphasises the general point that this Tribunal does not sit
as a court of appeals for the courts of the United States, and in any event “legal error” by a

court when applying U.S. law does not give rise to a violation of the NAFTA.

Vv. THE JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS

(A) INTRODUCTION

135. It is the Respondent’s case that Apotex’s claims are not properly before this Tribunal, and

that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain them, on the following grounds:

(a) Apotex does not qualify as an “investor”, who has made an “investment” in the

U.S., for the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139;

(b) Apotex failed to pursue available remedies within the U.S. Court system with
respect to its Pravastatin Claim, such that the judicial acts now complained of lack

sufficient finality to form the basis of claims under NAFTA Chapter Eleven;
(c) the time bar in NAFTA Article 1116(2) precludes Apotex’s allegation in its
Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration that the FDA’s letter decision of 11 April 2006

(determining that the 180-day exclusivity period had not been triggered) itself
constituted a violation of Articles 1102, 1105, and 1110 of the NAFTA.

136. Each objection is considered in turn below.

NO “INVESTMENT” OR “INVESTOR”

 

i. Relevant Prov:

NAFTA Article 1101 establishes the scope and coverage of the entire investment chapter
(Chapter Eleven) of the NAFTA, and expressly limits this to those “measures” adopted or

maintained by a Party “relating to”:
(a) “investors of another Party” (NAFTA Article 1101(1)(a)) and to

(b) “investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party’ (NAFTA
Article 1101(1)(b)).?

Accordingly, NAFTA Article 1116 requires that claimants submitting claims to arbitration

pursuant to this section be “investors” of a NAFTA Party.
The term “investor of a Party” is defined in NAFTA Article 1139 as follows:

“a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or enterprise of such Party,

that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment.”
As noted in Bayview Irrigation District et al. v. United Mexican States, \CSID Case No.
ARB(AF)/05/1, Award (on Jurisdiction) para. 105 (19 June 2007) — if indeed any authority

is needed for this proposition:

“in order to be an ‘investor’? under Article 1139 one must make an
. : . : 2
investment in the territory of another NAFTA State, not in one’s own.”??

» Article 1101 has been described as the “gateway leading to the dispute resolution provisions of Chapter 11,”
whose requirements limit the powers of a Chapter Eleven arbitral tribunal. See e.g., Methanex Corp. v. United
States, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, First Partial Award, para. 106 (7 Aug. 2002); Bayview Irrigation District and others
v. United Mexican States, \CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1, Award on Jurisdiction, para. 85 (19 June 2007). For the
sake of completeness, NAFTA Article 1101(1)(c) also provides for the application of Chapter Eleven to investments
with respect to NAFTA Articles 1106 and 1114 (which are of no relevance here).

Page 42 of 120

141. The term “investment” is defined in NAFTA Article 1139 as follows:

“investment means:
(a) anenterprise;
(b) an equity security of an enterprise;
(c) adebt security of an enterprise
@ where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or

(ii) where the original maturity of the debt security is at least three
years,

but does not include a debt security, regardless of original maturity, of a
state enterprise;

d) a loan to an enterprise
rp
@ where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor, or
(ii) where the original maturity of the loan is at least three years,

but does not include a loan, regardless of original maturity, to a state
enterprise;

(e) an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or
profits of the enterprise;

(f) an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in the assets of
that enterprise on dissolution, other than a debt security or a loan
excluded from subparagraph (c) or (d);

(g) real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the
expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business
purposes; and

 

° See similarly: Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade v. United States, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Award on
Jurisdiction, para. 126 (28 Jan. 2008); Grand River Enterprises Six Nations Ltd. v. United States,
NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Award, para. 87 (12 Jan. 2011) (NAFTA Chapter Eleven is applicable “only to investors of
one NAFTA Party who seek to make, are making, or have made an investment in another NAFTA Party: absent
those conditions, both the substantive protection of Section A and the remedies provided in Section B of Chapter
Eleven are unavailable to an investor”).

Page 43 of 120

(h) _ interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the
territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under

(ji contracts involving the presence of an investor’s property in the
territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts,
or concessions, or

(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the
production, revenues or profits of an enterprise;

but investment does not mean,
(i) claims to money that arise solely from
(ji commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a
national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in
the territory of another Party, or
(ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial
transaction, such as trade financing, other than a loan covered by
subparagraph (d); or
(j) any other claims to money,
that do not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a) through

(h)

142. Apotex has emphasised that Article 1139 is drawn broadly.** But as stated in Grand

River:

“[In contrast to the] ICSID Convention or other regional and bilateral
treaties ... containing broad and sometimes open-textured definitions of
investment ... NAFTA’s Article 1139 is neither broad nor open-textured,”

“prescribes an exclusive list of elements or activities that constitute an
investment for purposes of NAFTA”?

** Citing e.g, North American Free Trade Agreement, Implementation Act, Statement of Administrative Action,
TLR. Doe. No. 103-159, Vol. 1, 103d Cong. Ist Sess., at 140 (“‘Investment’ is broadly defined in Article 1139, and
both existing and future investments are covered”).

144.

145.

146.

As observed by the Respondent, the NAFTA as a whole recognises that businesses can and
do engage in different types of economic activity, and thus different remedies are provided
for, depending on the type of activity in question. For example (and of particular note
here), a company’s activities undertaken in its capacity as a foreign exporter of goods into
the territory of a NAFTA Party are not addressed by Chapter Eleven, but rather by Chapter
Three.

With the exception of the investment provisions of Chapter Eleven (and two provisions of
Chapter Fifteen), the Parties to the NAFTA limited dispute resolution for alleged violations
of most of the treaty, including Chapter Three, to the state-to-state dispute resolution
mechanisms set out in Chapter Twenty.”° Only Chapter Eleven, which addresses foreign
investments, includes the NAFTA Parties’ consent to arbitration brought by an individual

claimant directly against a NAFTA Party for breach of that Chapter.

ii. The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Apotex’s

claims, which fall outwith the scope and coverage of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

In outline,” the Respondent contends that:

(a) As Claimant, Apotex bears the burden of proving at the jurisdictional stage the
factual elements necessary to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, including its
claims that it was an “investor” with a qualifying “investment”. Apotex has failed

to discharge this burden.

 

°5 Grand River, Award, para. 82.

*6 See e.g., Canadian Cattlemen, Award on Jurisdiction, para. 193 (the “remedy” for claimant’s “trade dispute” “lies
not in the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism of Chapter Eleven, but in the state-to-state dispute resolution
mechanism of Chapter 20 of the NAFTA”).

?7 Further detail of the Respondent’s submissions is set out in the course of the Tribunal’s analysis below.

Apotex is a Canadian entity with no relevant presence or activity in the United

States;

With respect to Apotex’s actual development and manufacture of generic drugs,
all its activities in relation to both its sertraline and pravastatin products take place
outside of the United States (including, inter alia, the development, manufacture;

processing; testing; packaging; and labelling of each drug);

Apotex’s products, once manufactured outside the United States, are then

exported by Apotex to United States-based distributors;

With respect to Apotex’s preparation of ANDA submissions, this activity also

takes place outside the United States;

Ultimately, therefore, Apotex is no more than an exporter of goods into the United
States, for which, as with all other exporters of the same goods, it was required to
secure regulatory clearance by the filing of ANDAs. None of this amounts to
“investment” activity as contemplated by NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

Accordingly, Apotex’s claims must be dismissed in their entirety.

Apotex’s Position

147. It is Apotex’s case that both its Sertraline and Pravastatin Claims satisfy all jurisdictional

requirements for an action pursuant to Chapter Eleven of NAFTA.

148. In outline,”* Apotex contends that:

(hy

Article 1139 of NAFTA defines “investment” broadly.

Apotex invested millions of dollars in developing its products and preparing and
filing its ANDAs with the FDA, in accordance with U.S. statutory and regulatory

requirements, in order to attain an economic benefit in the United States.

The sole purpose of Apotex’s development and submission of its ANDAs was to

obtain FDA approval to commercialise its ANDA products in the United States.

These ANDAs (and everything that went into their development and submission)
were and are manifestly a United States investment—that is, “property, tangible
or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic

benefit or other business purposes.”

Further, Apotex made substantial commitments of capital and other resources in
the United States towards this economic activity (namely, the approval and sale of
its ANDA products) in the United States. Such commitments included the
purchase of raw materials for its ANDA products from suppliers in the United

States.

Apotex also designated its U.S. affiliate and distributor (Apotex Corp.) as its U.S.
Agent for FDA regulatory purposes and submissions, as required by U.S. law.

Further still, Apotex designated an agent for service of process in the United
States, thus consenting to jurisdiction and suit there, and committed substantial
resources litigating its ANDA products in the United States—all necessary for the

commercialisation of its investments in the United States.

Under the plain terms of NAFTA, Apotex is therefore an “investor” that made
“investments .. . in the territory of the Party,” thus bestowing this Tribunal with

the necessary jurisdiction to hear its claims on their merits.

iv. The Tribunal’s Analysis

(a) “Investment”

This issue obviously turns upon the precise (i) location and (ii) nature of each of the
activities / property relied upon by Apotex as an “investment” for the purposes of NAFTA
Article 1139.

Apotex (as Claimant) bears the burden of proof with respect to the factual elements

necessary to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this regard.”°

The Alleged “Investment”: The exercise of identifying a precise “investment” for the
purposes of NAFTA Article 1139 evidently caused Apotex some difficulty in this case.

Indeed, this proved something of a moving target in the course of the proceedings.

In its Statement of Claims (paras. 62, 111), Apotex did not identify any specific sub-
paragraphs of NAFTA Article 1139, but stated that it:

“has made substantial ‘investments,’ including, but not limited to, the
expenditure of millions of dollars each year in preparing ANDAs for filing
in the United States, and formulating, developing, and manufacturing
approved generic pharmaceutical products for sale in the United States and
throughout the world.”

Similarly, in para. 23 of its Statement of Claims, Apotex stated that it:

. invests millions of dollars in designing and formulating its proposed
drug products, procuring or manufacturing the active pharmaceutical
ingredients for such products, preparing and filing applications with the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) seeking approval to market and sell
its drug products in the United States, and manufacturing the finished drug
products.”

» See e.g., Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, paras. 58-64 (15 Apr.
2009) (summarising previous decisions, and concluding that “if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts,
they have to be proven [rather than merely established prima facie] at the jurisdictional phase”).

Page 48 of 120

154. In its submission in support of a stay (para. 48), Apotex identified its “investment at issue”

simply as:

“Apotex’s [Sertraline/Pravastatin] ANDA products.”

155. Thereafter, in its Counter-Memorial on Respondent’s Objections to Jurisdiction, dated 1

August 2011, Apotex characterised its “investment” in the following ways:

(a) in terms of the actual ANDA filings themselves, which were said to constitute
“property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the
purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes” (NAFTA Article

1139(g)); and

(b) in terms of other significant investments made by Apotex in the United States that
involve “the commitment of capital or other resources in the [United States] to
economic activity in such territory,” including “contracts involving the presence

of [Apotex’s] property in the [United States]” (NAFTA Article 1139(h)).

156. These points were again set out in Apotex’s Rejoinder, dated 16 December 2011, but with

the clarification that, for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(h), Apotex’s

“investment interests lie in its ANDAs, not merely in claims for money
arising from its supply contracts or relationships with its U.S. agent or U.S.
attorneys.”*”

157. Overall, it would appear that - across all its submissions - Apotex has advanced three

distinct alleged “investments”:

(a) the formulation, development and manufacture of approved generic

pharmaceutical products for sale in the United States;

* Rejoinder, para. 6.

Page 49 of 120

158.

159.

160.

161.

162.

163.

(b) the preparation of ANDAs for filing in the United States, including all the effort

and expenditure that this entails, and the resulting ANDAs themselves;

(c) other significant investments made in the territory of the United States, including
(inter alia) utilisation of its US affiliate, Apotex Corp.; the purchase of raw

materials and ingredients in the United States; and expenditure on US litigation.

Analysis: Having carefully considered the entire record in this case, the Tribunal is
clear that none of Apotex’s characterisations of its alleged “investment” meet the

requirements of NAFTA Article 1139, whether considered separately or together.
Each of Apotex’s characterisations is addressed in turn below.

i Development and Manufacture of Products
Apotex’s first characterisation of its alleged “investment” focuses upon the “formulating,
developing, and manufacturing” of the pharmaceuticals in issue. This cannot qualify for
the purposes of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, for the simple reason that all the activities relied
upon in relation to both sertraline and pravastatin products occur in Canada, not in the

territory of the United States.

As noted above, activity by an exporter in the latter’s own country does not constitute an

“investment” under Article 1139.

The position with respect to Apotex and its activities is as follows.

The Company Apotex: In paragraph 2 of its Statement of Claim of 17 January
2011, Apotex describes itself as:

Page 50 of 120

164.

165.

166.

167.

168.

“a corporation duly incorporated and existing under the laws of Canada and
having a principal place of business at: Apotex Inc. 150 Signet Drive
Weston, Ontario, Canada M91 1T9.”

Apotex began business operations on 24 May 1974, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Apotex Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc., located in North York, Ontario.*! It appears that

Apotex was registered as a corporation under Ontario law on 1 April 2004.”

By its own admission, it does not reside or have a place of business in the United States.**

It is to be noted that Apotex has not brought its claims under NAFTA Article 1117, which
is entitled “Claim by an Investor of a Party on behalf of an enterprise.” In other words, it
has brought its claims on its own behalf and not on behalf of any enterprise established in

the U.S. - because Apotex does not claim to have established an enterprise there.

Similarly, Apotex has not claimed to have an equity or a debt interest in any U.S.
company. It has not claimed to have purchased property or to have built facilities or to
have hired a workforce in the U.S. And it has not claimed to have developed, tested, or

manufactured its drugs in the United States.

Apotex’s Operations: Apotex develops pharmaceutical products in Canada for the
domestic Canadian market, as well as for export to a large number of other countries,

including the United States. Indeed, according to its website, as cited by the Respondent:

“[t]he company’s pharmaceuticals can be found in virtually every pharmacy
and healthcare facility in Canada and are exported to over 115 countries
around the globe”

and

“(e]xport markets represent an ever growing portion of the total sales.”**

169. For exports to the U.S. market, Apotex’s website indicates that Apotex has built three
“extensive” facilities in Ontario, Canada, at:
(a) Etobicoke
(b) Richmond Hill, and
(c) the Signet Campus.*°

170. Apotex carries out drug development and manufacturing activities from these three

campuses. *°

171. Development and Manufacture of Sertraline Products: As noted in Section

III above, ANDA applicants must include in their application (inter alia):

- detailed information about the research undertaken to establish bio-equivalence,
including the address of the facility or facilities conducting the relevant bio-

equivalence study;

- a description, including a full address, of the facility for manufacturing,
processing, testing, and packaging of the proposed product, and sample labelling

for the proposed product with the address of the manufacturer of the product.

172. Notably, in its ANDA submission for sertraline oral tablets, dated 27 October 2003:

(b) Apotex Corp. (an Illinois entity) is designated as Apotex’s “Authorized U.S.

there is no indication that this entity has any role in the development,

manufacture, or testing of Apotex’s products.®

(c) The proposed container label for sertraline tablets (submitted with the ANDA)
indicates that manufacturing of Apotex’s sertraline products occurs in Canada, for

export to, and sale by, Apotex Corp., as follows:*°

“Manufactured by:

173. Development and Manufacture of Pravastatin Products: Similarly, in its ANDA

submission for pravastatin oral tablets, dated 21 December 2001:

(a) Apotex’s facility at is listed as performing:

(b) Apotex Corp. is designated as Apotex’s “Authorized U.S. Agent”.*? Once again,
Apotex Corp. is not listed anywhere as developing, manufacturing, or testing
Apotex products, but is simply described as a U.S.based distributor.*

(c) As with its sertraline products, the proposed container label for pravastatin tablets
(submitted with its ANDA) indicates that manufacturing occurs in Canada for

export to, and sale by, Apotex Corp., as follows:*°

“Manufactured by:

Manufactured for:

 

174. Thus, on the basis of Apotex’s own regulatory filings, it is clear that both its sertraline and
pravastatin products are formulated, developed, manufactured, tested and labelled outside

the United States, and then exported by Apotex to (separate) U.S.-based distributors.

® ANDA — Pravastatin (21 Dec. 2001) at 5370, and at p. 0003 (FDA Form 356h) noting that “TorPharm [i.e.

179.

Apotex could, of course, have invested in U.S.-based manufacturing, development, or
testing facilities, but opted instead to create and manufacture its generic pharmaceuticals in
Canadian factories. Indeed, in its U.S. federal court filings related to pravastatin, Apotex
made clear that it invested in a factory in Winnipeg, Canada, for the development and

production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, pravastatin sodium.*”
It follows that Apotex’s formulation, development, and manufacture of the
pharmaceuticals in issue does not qualify for the purposes of NAFTA Chapter Eleven,
since these are all activities conducted outside of the United States.

ii. The ANDA Submissions Themselves
Apotex’s second characterisation of its alleged “investment” focuses upon the actual
ANDA submissions themselves. Properly analysed, this submission has two distinct
elements:
(a) the activity of preparing each ANDA for filing in the United States, and

(b) the actual ANDA itself, as an item of “property”.

In the Tribunal’s view, neither element qualifies for the purposes of NAFTA Chapter

Eleven.

The Activity of Preparing ANDAs: Apotex has made detailed submissions as to the
substantial nature of ANDAs, and the huge effort and expenditure required to compile

them.

development and production of pravastatin) [R58].

180. In particular, Apotex points to the statutory and regulatory requirements for ANDA
approval, which are not only extensive, but specific to the United States (i.e. different to
the requirements for other countries). By way of example, in order to sell a product in the
United States, an ANDA applicant must meet the FDA’s so-called “Current Good
Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals”, which imposes strict requirements
governing the testing, manufacturing and labelling of the ANDA products.** These

include, inter alia:

(a) Particular laboratory controls; stability testing programs; batch production and
process controls; in-process controls for sampling; and procedures for identifying;
storing; handling; sampling; testing and approving drug products, components and

containers;””

(b) Strict requirements governing the documentation of such testing, sampling, and

manufacturing, and the controls for each;*”

(c) Specific requirements relating to the design; size; location; construction and
maintenance of the facilities and equipment used in manufacturing, processing,
packaging, testing, or storage of its drug products, regardless of where such
facilities and equipment are located.*! Indeed, as Apotex noted, the FDA inspects
each applicant’s manufacturing facilities, whether domestic or foreign, to ensure

that the establishment is capable of manufacturing the proposed drug product in

491 CFR. § 211 et seq. [C43].

accordance with the FDA’s requirements, and that the submitted data is accurate

and complete.”

181. According to Apotex, the FDA’s approval requirements differ significantly from those in
other countries.*> This means that when Apotex invests its financial and other resources
towards designing, formulating, and manufacturing an ANDA product, and preparing the
ANDA itself, it does so with the expectation of marketing such product solely in the

United States.**

182. Further, Apotex emphasises that the efforts it made to comply with the FDA’s processing,
manufacturing, testing, sampling, packaging, and storage requirements were product-

specific.*> For example:

(a) Formulation and development work on Apotex’s sertraline tablets obviously does

not carry over to Apotex’s pravastatin tablets, or indeed any other product;

(b) Testing conducted to show that Apotex’s sertraline tablets are bio-equivalent to
Zoloft® cannot be used to demonstrate bio-equivalence of Apotex’s pravastatin

tablets to Pravachol”, and vice versa.*°

(c) Apotex’s in-process and manufacturing controls are specific to each product.*”

(d) Apotex obviously cannot reuse labels designed for either its sertraline or

pravastatin products in the sale of another product.**

183. On the basis of all these points, it is Apotex’s case that the costs it has incurred in meeting
the specific FDA requirements for approval of its sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs are
“investments” under Article 1139.°° Apotex would never have incurred these expenses if it
had not been required to do so under U.S. statutory and federal regulatory requirements.”
Likewise, the only reason Apotex undertook the enormous expense and effort to comply
with these U.S.-specific requirements was to obtain approval for, and to market and sell, its

sertraline and pravastatin ANDA products in the United States.°!

184. Apotex placed heavy reliance here upon the statement in Grand River Enterprises Six

Nations, Ltd. et al. v. United States that:

“a salient characteristic of an investment covered by the protection of
NAFTA Chapter Eleven would be that the investment is primarily regulated
by the law of a state other than the state of the investor’s nationality, and
that this law is created and applied by that state which is not the state of the
investor’s nationality.”

185. Further, Apotex argues that all this activity should be persuasive evidence that it had an

investment in the territory of the United States. For this, Apotex relies upon the statement

of the Tribunal in SGS v. Philippines that:

“SGS’s inspections abroad were not carried out for their own sake but in
order to enable it to provide, in the Philippines, an inspection certificate on
which [the Philippines] could rely to enter goods . . .”°*

186. The Tribunal is unpersuaded that the costs and effort expended in preparing ANDAs either
constitutes or evidences an “investment” in the United States, for the purposes of NAFTA

Chapter Eleven. This is for a number of reasons.

187. First, whilst ANDAs are of course filed within the territory of the United States, the actual
activity in question (the preparation of each submission) is evidently conducted by Apotex

outside of the United States. Specifically, it is reported that at the Signet Campus:

“operations focus on product development activities, which include product
formulation and process development, production and evaluation of clinical
batches, analytical development and assessment as well as the creation and
submission of generic drug approvals.”

188. Second, it is common ground that an ANDA must be submitted by any manufacturer of
generic drugs that seeks to have its products sold in the United States. This is so regardless
of whether the manufacturer is investing in, or merely exporting to, the United States.
Consequently, the preparation of the filing, in and of itself, does not establish that a generic

drug manufacturer is investing in, rather than exporting products to, the United States.

189. Notably in this case, whilst Apotex describes itself as a Canadian manufacturer and

exporter of:

“approved generic pharmaceutical products for sale in the United States and
throughout the world,”°>

© $GS Société Générale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Philippines, \CSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision of
the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 101 (29 Jan. 2004).

and whilst, in its ANDAs, Apotex sought approval for the sale of its sertraline and
pravastatin products in the United States, it is clear that the actual sale of these products in

the United States was always to be conducted by parties other than Apotex itself. Hence in

 

each of its Notices of Arbitration, Apotex states (at para. 13) that:

“before one of Apotex’s generic drugs can be sold by others in the United
States, Apotex must obtain approval from the [FDA].”

[emphasis added].

190. Third, Apotex’s reliance on the Grand River and Bayview awards to suggest that costs
incurred outside the United States in compliance with a U.S. regulatory regime can
constitute “investments” in the United States is misplaced. As noted, Apotex relies in

particular on the observation that “a salient characteristic of an investment” is:

“regulation by the law of a state other than the state of the investor’s
nationality.”°”

But both the Grand River and Bayview tribunals made clear that the law of the host State is
only one “salient” factor in determining whether expenditures qualify as an “investment”
under NAFTA Article 1139.® It is not, in itself, a sufficient factor. Hence, the Bayview
tribunal declined jurisdiction over all of the claimants’ claims, because the claimants had

not made an investment in the territory of the respondent State, stating:

“Tn the opinion of the Tribunal, it is quite plain that NAFTA Chapter Eleven
was not intended to provide substantive protections or rights of action to
investors whose investments are wholly confined to their own national
States, in circumstances where those investments may be affected by

measures taken by another NAFTA State Party. The NAFTA should not be
interpreted so as to bring about this unintended result.”

191. The Grand River tribunal similarly declined jurisdiction over most of the claimants’
claims, concluding that it did not have jurisdiction:

. over claims that are based on injury to investments located in one
NAFTA Party on account of actions taken by authorities in another.””°

192. Thus, as the Respondent has argued, the mere regulation of Apotex’s foreign products
(however extensive) cannot transform the costs incurred in developing those products into

investments in the United States.

193. Fourth, even if Apotex had incurred these regulatory costs in the United States, the
expenditures incurred in the preparation and filing of an ANDA submission, being no more
than an exercise in securing regulatory clearance, do not fall within the scope of NAFTA
Article 1139. Nor do they change the inherent nature of the activity for which clearance is

sought.

194. As the Grand River tribunal made clear, where a company must meet “regulatory
requirements” to sell its products in the United States, the costs of such compliance

themselves are not “investments”.’' Rather, those costs are:

“incident to ‘commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services,’ which
fall outside of Article 1139s definition of investment.”

© Bayview, Award, para. 103.

™ Grand River, Award, para. 87. See similarly paras. 5-6, where the tribunal held that it did “.. . not have
jurisdiction over the claims of Kenneth Hill, Jerry Montour and Grand River, because they did not have an
investment in the United States,” but that it did“... have jurisdiction over Arthur Montour’s claim,” because “he
created a substantial business in the United States, importing cigarettes manufactured by Grand River and
distributing them... in the United States’).

" Grand River, Award, para. 115. It may be recalled that Grand River claimed to have spent approximately US$ 29
million dollars complying with U.S. statutory and regulatory requirements for the purposes of marketing its generic

cigarettes in the United States.

Indeed, as the Respondent has pointed out, if preparing an ANDA could constitute an
“investment” under Article 1139, then any Canadian or Mexican exporter requiring U.S.
regulatory clearance to have its goods sold by third parties in the United States could
potentially bring an investment claim under NAFTA Chapter Eleven, whenever such
clearance, in the exporter’s view, was wrongly denied or delayed. This would be so
regardless of whether the exporter made or sought to make an investment in the United
States. The Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent’s submission that allowing a mere
application for regulatory clearance to export goods into the United States to give rise to an
“investment” claim under Chapter Eleven would be inconsistent with the core objectives of

NAFTA’s investment chapter.

The ANDA Submissions as “Property”: The second way in which this submission
was put by Apotex was to characterise the actual ANDA filing itself as “property . . .
acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business

purposes” in the United States, for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g).
This argument proceeded in a number of stages.

First, Apotex asserted that for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g), it had to identify
two separate elements: (a) “property”, (b) that was “acquired in the expectation or used for

the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes”.

Second, and with respect to element (a), it was asserted that an ANDA filing, and the
confidential data and information contained therein, constitutes the “property” of the
ANDA applicant. According to Apotex, once filed in the United States with the FDA, only

the “applicant may transfer ownership of its application.””> Further, an ANDA can be

203.

bought and sold like all other property,” and (bearing in mind the general definition of
“property” in Black’s Law Dictionary), the ANDA applicant has the exclusive right to

possess, use and enjoy the ANDA, as well as the products approved thereunder. ”*

Hence, the FDA is obligated to maintain confidential all information in unapproved
ANDAs and is not even permitted to confirm the existence of an unapproved ANDA

unless the ANDA sponsor itself has already done so.”°

Third, with respect to the second element in NAFTA Article 1139(g), all investments in
each ANDA were effected “. . . in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic

benefit or other business purposes” in the United States.

Apotex submitted that while an ANDA, and the products approved thereunder,
unquestionably are property of the applicant, the value of an ANDA is intrinsically tied to
FDA approval in the United States (or the promise of future approval in the United States).
If an ANDA is never approved and the product can never be sold, the ANDA in question is

then essentially worthless.”

Further, as already noted, an ANDA is an extremely substantial document. It generally
comprises thousands, if not tens of thousands, of pages containing confidential and
proprietary information pertaining to the formulation, development, manufacture,

processing, testing, packaging, labelling, and storage of the proposed generic drug product.

™ Hence the MMA requires that certain agreements between two ANDA applicants, or between ANDA applicants
and brand name drug manufacturers, regarding an ANDA be submitted to the Federal Trade Commission and the
United States Assistant Attorney General (MMA § 1112).

’ Citing Black’s Law Dictionary 1232, “property” (9th ed. 2009). According to Apotex, whether an ANDA, and
the data and information contained therein, is considered tangible or intangible property makes no difference, since
the United States Supreme Court has stated that the intangible nature of certain business information does not make
it any less “property” (citing McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 356 (1987).

" Citing 18 U.S.C. § 1905; 21 U.S.C. § 331(); 21 CFR. § 314.430.

204.

205.

206.

207.

On the basis of these points, Apotex then contended that it is therefore more than simply an
“exporter”. It cannot export and commercialise anything in the United States without an
approved ANDA, and without undertaking the investment and development that goes into
that ANDA. An ANDA is therefore a uniquely United States investment. It is also of no

use anywhere else.

According to Apotex, unlike a mere import permit or certificate, it is the pharmaceutical
product and investment itself that is necessary not only to get a product into the United
States, but also to make and ultimately realise the commercial value of that investment. In

other words, without the ANDA, there is no product to commercialise in the United States.

The Tribunal has carefully considered all aspects of this submission, and all evidence on
which it is based. But in the Tribunal’s view, neither of Apotex’s sertraline and pravastatin
ANDAs are properly characterised as “property acquired in the expectation or used for the
purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes,” within the meaning of NAFTA
Article 1139(g), and none of Apotex’s submissions are sufficient to distinguish itself from

a mere exporter of goods into the United States.

First, whilst an ANDA may be characterised for certain purposes as “property”,”* the
Tribunal does not consider that the nature of an ANDA is such as to fall within the
contemplated scope of NAFTA Article 1139(g), as that provision must be understood as a
whole, by reference to the objects and purposes of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.
Notwithstanding its very substantial nature, and the time and cost required for its
compilation, an ANDA, ultimately, remains simply an application for revocable permission

to (in this case) export a product for sale (by others) in the United States. Even if, as a

’8 The Tribunal accepts Apotex’s submission that U.S. law is informative in defining “property”, because it is the
law of the host State. See e.g., Rosalyn Higgins, The Taking of Property by the State: Recent Developments in
International Law, 176 Recueil des Cours 263, 270 (1982) (for a definition of “property . . . [w]e necessarily draw
on municipal law sources and on general principles of law”); Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States,
NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Award, para. 37 (8 June 2009), examining U.S. law to determine whether an “unpatented
mining claim” constituted “property”.

210.

technical matter, the application may be “owned”, unlike Apotex’s approach, the Tribunal
does not consider that NAFTA Article 1139(g) can be approached by divorcing the concept

of “property” from its context, and applying it in the abstract.

As observed by the Respondent, property is not an “investment” if, as here, it merely

supports cross-border sales.

Second, this is all the more so here because (as the Respondent has emphasised) on the
date of the alleged NAFTA breaches, the sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs were only
tentatively approved by the FDA. It follows that at the relevant time, (a) Apotex’s ANDAs
could not (yet) be characterised as “property” for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g),
and (b), even if they did constitute “property”, Apotex’s ANDAs were not yet “acquired in
the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes,”
given that the only economic benefit or other business purpose Apotex claims is the right
to sell drugs in the U.S., and given that this right was neither acquired nor enjoyed by

virtue of tentatively approved ANDAs.

The FDA grants “tentative approval” to an ANDA when all scientific and procedural
conditions for approval have been met. But the FDA does not finally approve an ANDA
until various other barriers to approval no longer apply,” and an application with a
tentative approval will not become finally approved until the FDA issues a final approval
letter.*° Even then, final approval of a tentatively-approved ANDA is not automatic,
because the FDA still “has an ongoing health and safety responsibility to perform.”*' The
FDA may revoke tentative approval, or even final approval, of ANDAs for a variety of
reasons related to the new products’ safety and effectiveness, including (inter alia) a
finding that there is an imminent hazard to public health; that clinical or other tests or

scientific data indicate any lack of safety; or a lack of substantial evidence from adequate

and well controlled investigations that the drug will have the effect it is reported or
represented to have. The regulations expressly afford the FDA a broad discretion in this

regard.

211.

In this case, the FDA informed Apotex in terms that its tentatively-approved ANDAs for
sertraline and pravastatin were “subject to change on the basis of new information that may

82

come to [FDA's] attention. The same letters instructed Apotex to apply for final

approval of its ANDAs, and noted that the tentative approval could be rescinded.

212. As part of the application process, Apotex received several notices of deficiency for both
sertraline and pravastatin, including at least one notice following the tentative approval.
These notices required Apotex to supplement its ANDAs with additional information
before they could be finally approved, and before permission could be granted to export its

generic drugs to the United States. *?

Similarly, Apotex alleges that the pravastatin-related NAFTA breaches occurred no later
than August 2006.*° This was prior to the FDA’s final approval of Apotex’s pravastatin
ANDA.*”

Apotex responded to this by asserting that but for the Respondent’s alleged breach of its
legal obligations, Apotex would have been granted final, not tentative, approval because no
other impediments to approval existed at that time. The Tribunal is unpersuaded by this
submission. Whether or not each of Apotex’s ANDAs would have been granted final
approval is by no means certain on the evidence. But in any event, the critical enquiry
must be as to the nature of the alleged “property” as at the date of the alleged breach — not

at some future point.

Third, Apotex’s argument that an ANDA cannot be equated with an application for an
export or import licence is unconvincing. Apotex submits that ANDAs are never treated as

export or import licences in the relevant U.S. statutes and regulations, and that:

“Anyone who wants to engage in the pharmaceutical market in the United
States, whether domestic or foreign, regardless of what borders that drug or
product may have to cross, they have to do an ANDA. There is no
exception. So, it’s not an import or export permit.”**

But the fact that domestic U.S. companies are also required to submit ANDAs appears to
miss the point. Whilst an ANDA itself may not be, in strict technical terms, an export or

import licence, it operated - in this case - in precisely the same way. As already noted, all

Apotex’s operations were outside of the U.S. Apotex wanted to export its goods to the

U.S., to be marketed and sold there by other entities. In order to do this, Apotex was
required to obtain permission, which was to be secured by the submission of an ANDA.
The ANDA was thus a requirement in order to conduct an export business. If there had
been no ANDA process, the underlying business could not be said to be an “investment” in

the U.S. The fact that an ANDA was required does not change the nature of the business.

Further, the fact that the ANDA process is governed exclusively by U.S. law and
regulations does not change the nature of the process: it remains an application to permit
the sale of goods which in this case are to be produced entirely outside of the U.S., and to

be exported for sale by others.

Fourth, the Tribunal is not persuaded that an ANDA must be characterised as “property”
for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g) because it contains “confidential data and
information”. As the Respondent has observed, Apotex may have a right under U.S. law
to have its disclosures to the FDA kept confidential, but there is no basis for this to
transform the inherent nature of the ANDA itself, from an application for permission to
export goods into the United States, into some form of investment within the scope of

NAFTA Article 1139(g).

Fifth, Apotex’s asserts that ANDAs “can be bought and sold like all other property,” but
it remains entirely unclear whether a tentatively-approved ANDA (i.e. as distinct from (i) a
finally-approved ANDA, and (ii) a finally-approved ANDA plus associated products) has
value. It is to be recalled that a tentatively-approved ANDA provides no permission to
export generic drugs into the United States for sale. Further, as Apotex itself made clear:
“[i]f an ANDA is never approved and the product can never be sold, such ANDA is

vl

essentially worthless.” And yet Apotex has insisted that:

224.

“Apotex’s investment in its ANDAs, and its property rights therein, are
actualized the moment such ANDAs are filed with the FDA.”

The Tribunal acknowledges Apotex’s argument that companies do, nevertheless buy, sell,
and calculate the estimated value of ANDAs that have not yet received approval (albeit
most examples given were in the context of broader purchases / rearrangements of
pharmaceutical businesses, rather than individual unapproved ANDAs). But even if an
ANDA may be bought and sold as Apotex argues, this would still not change its essential
character, which is an application to (in this case) export generic drugs into the United
States. As such, the Tribunal considers that it would still not qualify for the purposes of
NAFTA Article 1139(g).

Sixth, Apotex’s assertion that an ANDA applicant has “the exclusive right to possess, use

o» 92

and enjoy the ANDA and the products approved thereunder”, ~ takes the matter no further.
Even if Apotex has exclusive rights over the ANDA, this cannot change the inherent nature
of the ANDA itself. In other words, an application to export generic drugs into the United
States is not transformed into an “investment” for the purposes of NAFTA Chapter Eleven,

because the holder of the application has exclusive rights thereto.

Indeed, it may be noted that Apotex’s asserted “exclusivity” is open to question in any
event. As already noted, no products could be sold until the ANDAs had been finally
approved. All that Apotex held at the relevant time were tentatively-approved applications
for revocable permission, which were subject to continual regulatory oversight and
monitoring in the public interest. And even when finally approved, Apotex was not

protected from changes to, or revocation of, its ANDAs.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Apotex’s submissions as to the notion
and general characteristics of “property” (based upon Black’s Law Dictionary) are of only

limited assistance in delimiting NAFTA Article 1139(g). The jurisdictional issue here

 

*' Counter-Memorial, para. 38.

* Counter-Memorial, para. 37.

226.

227.

turns upon the inherent nature of the relevant ANDAs, not the nature of Apotex’s rights
over them. As set out above, even assuming that the ANDAs were Apotex’s exclusive
“property”, they remained no more than applications for permission to (in this case) export,
and as such neither fell within NAFTA Article 1139(g), nor constituted “investments” as

contemplated more generally by NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

Thus, neither Apotex’s ANDAs, nor its activities in Canada, nor the costs incurred there in
meeting the requirements of the U.S. regulatory regime for exporting its goods, are

“investments” in the United States.

Apotex’s third characterisation of its alleged “investment” focuses upon “other significant”
investments said to have been made in the territory of the United States, within the scope

of NAFTA Article 1139(h).

In its written submissions, Apotex asserted that it has committed significant capital and
resources towards the preparation, filing and maintenance of its sertraline and pravastatin
ANDAs and products in the United States, as well as towards U.S. patent litigation arising
as a result of these ANDAs. In particular:°*

(a) Because Apotex does not reside or have a place of business in the United States,
in accordance with FDA’s regulations, Apotex has utilised its U.S. affiliate,
Apotex Corp., (a Delaware corporation with a place of business in Florida) as its
U.S. Agent for all correspondence and submissions to the FDA for its pravastatin

and sertraline ANDAs.”*

(b)

(c)

Apotex Corp. also acts as the distributor for both of Apotex’s pravastatin and
sertraline ANDA products.”> According to Apotex, the sale of its ANDA
products in the United States qualifies as “economic activity in [the] territory,”
the proceeds of which go directly, and in full, to it and its affiliates. Further,
Apotex’s relationship with its U.S. affiliate, agent and distributor (Apotex Corp.)
also independently qualifies as “an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner
to share in income or profits of the enterprise” for the purposes of NAFTA Art

1139(e), and so qualifies as an “investment.”

Apotex has also committed significant capital in the United States towards the
purchase of raw materials and ingredients used in its sertraline and pravastatin
ANDA products, which again are sold solely in the United States. Apotex

emphasises that:

- it purchased all but one of the inactive ingredients used in the
manufacture of its pravastatin sodium tablets (10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg)
from U.S. manufacturers,” and it spent over ; on these

ingredients;””

- it purchased all but two of the inactive ingredients used in the
manufacture of its sertraline hydrochloride tablets (25 mg, 50 mg and 100
mg), from U.S. manufacturers,”* and spent nearly | on these

ingredients;””

- each of these ingredients is essential to the formulation and manufacture
of both sertraline and pravastatin products, and is a substantial and non-

severable aspect of Apotex’s overall investment in each ANDA.

(d) As a consequence of filing a paragraph IV certification in connection with both its
sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs, Apotex was required by the FDA regulation to
designate a U.S. Agent to accept service of process for any patent litigation

initiated in response to its sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs.'°°

In doing so,
Apotex notes that it consented to jurisdiction and suit in the United States, thus
exposing itself to patent litigation in U.S. federal courts, and the potential for
incurring substantial sums in legal fees in connection with this U.S. litigation.'°!
And in this regard, Apotex has spent in excess of in legal fees in
connection with its sertraline ANDA litigation, and in excess of | in
legal fees in connection with its pravastatin ANDA litigation, all such expenses
having been incurred in the United States.'°? Apotex emphasises that this
expenditure was made for the sole purpose of “securing an economic benefit from

the sale of its sertraline and pravastatin ANDA products in the United States”.

228. Apotex emphasised that other tribunals (under other treaties) have recognised that
claimants need not have incurred all, or even most, of their expenses inside the territory of

the host State citing, inter alia, SGS v. Philippines, at para. 106:

“The fact that the bulk of the cost of providing the service was incurred
outside the Philippines is not decisive.”

and SGS v. Pakistan,'° at para. 136:

“While the expenditures [in Pakistan related to SGS’s extraterritorial
customs inspection] may be relatively small ... they involved the injection of
funds into the territory of Pakistan for carrying out SDS’s engagements
under the PSI Agreement.”

229. In the course of its oral submissions, Apotex then made clear that its submissions under
NAFTA Article 1139(h) were to be treated as part of its submissions under NAFTA Article

1139(g), and not as independent grounds. This was specifically confirmed to the Tribunal:

“PRESIDENT LANDAU: ... The other point I just wanted to ask is, just for
clarity, the exact positioning of your Article 1139(h) case ... that actually
the 1139(h) argument, it doesn’t stand by itself; is that right? Is it dependent
upon us making a finding that the ANDA itself is an investment?

MR. RAKOCZY: Yes. Our basic argument is it’s part and parcel of the
ANDA investment because the commitments that had been made, the
commitments of capital, that’s why--and I apologize, Mr. President, it goes
back to some of your earlier questions. It’s hard to parcel out all the
elements that go into this investment, but all these things go into it: The
costs of development, the amount spent in the United States on the raw
materials all go into the ANDA investment itself, and then obviously the
substantial costs incurred in the litigation, the causes of action, obviously
are all part and parcel of the ANDA. We would not be able to separate
those.

PRESIDENT LANDAU: So, is it right to summarise the argument that
1139(h) is part of your 1139(g) argument? And if not you’re not asking us
to find 1139(h) by itself?

MR. RAKOCZY: Would you just give me one moment.

PRESIDENT LANDAU: Yes, of course.

(Pause.)

MR. RAKOCZY: Mr. President, we wouldn’t dispute that, yes, the sub (h)

claim basically relies on as part and parcel of the (g) claim, which is our
primary contention.”

230. In the Tribunal’s view, none of the items identified under NAFTA Article 1139(h) amounts
to an “investment” within NAFTA Chapter eleven, and whether considered separately or

together, none changes the analysis under NAFTA Article 1139(g).

231.

As set out earlier, NAFTA Article 1139(h) includes:

“(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in
the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under

(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor’s property in the
territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts,
or concessions, or

(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the
production, revenues or profits of an enterprise[.]”

232. But this article must be read with NAFTA Articles 1139(i) and (j), which clarify that

“investment does not mean”:

“(i)_ claims to money that arise solely from

(i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a national
or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in the
territory of another Party, or

(ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction,
such as trade financing, other than a loan covered by subparagraph
(@); or
(j) any other claims to money,

that do not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a)
through (h).”

233. Hence, as the Respondent has stressed, NAFTA Article 1139(h)’s focus on interests arising
from the commitment of capital in the host State to economic activity in such territory —

excludes simple cross-border trade interests. Something more permanent is necessary.

234. By way of example, in Mondev v. United States, the Canadian claimant alleged that

through its wholly owned U.S. limited partnership, it obtained interests arising from

Page 74 of 120

235.

236.

contractual rights to develop large parcels of property in downtown Boston. The tribunal

thus concluded that, through the rights acquired in these construction contracts:

“Mondev’s claims involved interests arising from the commitment of capital
or other resources in the territory of the United States”

which fell squarely within the definition of “investment” under NAFTA Article 1139(h).

On being challenged to identify precisely what investment “interests” arose from its
designation of a U.S. agent and distributor; the purchase of U.S. raw materials; or the

incurring of U.S. legal fees,'°* Apotex stated as follows in its Rejoinder:

“Apotex’s investment “interests” lie in the submission, maintenance and
utilization of its sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs and in achieving an
economic benefit from the marketing and sale of the products subject to
such ANDAs in the United States”. !°°

In the Tribunal’s considered view, this is inadequate to meet the requirements of NAFTA
Article 1139. The “interests” so identified amount to no more than the ordinary conduct
of a business for the export and sale of goods. And as set out below, each of the specific
activities and expenses relied upon by Apotex simply supported and facilitated its

Canadian-based manufacturing and export operations.

Designation of Apotex Corp. as U.S. Agent: — Apotex’s designation of its U.S. affiliate as
its agent for correspondence and submissions to the FDA with respect to its ANDAs
cannot, on any view, amount to an “investment”. In the Respondent’s words, it was simply
a “commercial contract for the sale of . . . services” incident to the regulatory requirements
of the U.S. market. It did not involve the kinds of interests that Article 1139 contemplated
as arising from the “commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party.”

On a fair reading of NAFTA, it is excluded as an “investment” by Article 1139(i).

237. Utilisation of Apotex Corp as U.S. Distributor: Similarly, the fact that Apotex Corp
acts as Apotex’s distributor of pravastatin and sertraline ANDA products in the United
States does not transform Apotex’s activity from one of export to one of investment. On
the contrary, it is simply the mechanism by which the export and sale is conducted. It is to
be noted that the Grand River tribunal found expressly that the appointment of a separate
company to distribute the claimants’ products did not transform the distributor into an

“investment” under NAFTA. °°

238. Apotex’s reliance on SGS v. Philippines and SGS v. Pakistan is of no assistance here.
Apart from the fact that neither case involved an interpretation of the NAFTA, which
provides its own definition of “investment”, in both cases the claimant had established
“liaison offices” in the respondent States.'°’ Apotex has not alleged any such investments
in the United States, but instead conceded that it “does not reside or have a place of

business in the United States.”'*

239. Purchase of Raw Materials in the U.S.: The Tribunal has no reason to doubt that
Apotex has committed significant capital in the United States towards the purchase of raw
materials and ingredients used in its sertraline and pravastatin ANDA products. But this
activity was evidently undertaken for the purposes of manufacturing in Canada products

intended for export to the United States (and subsequent sale by others). These were no

purchases Grand River's cigarettes and distributes them off reservation under the terms of a contract with Grand
River. It is a U.S. owned and controlled entity. It is not, and could not be, claimed as part of the Claimants’
investment’).

17 GS v. Pakistan, Decision, paras. 137, 140 (expenditures incurred in establishing and operating a liaison office in
the host State constituted an investment); SGS v. Philippines, Decision, paras. 101, 103 (expenditures incurred in
establishing and operating “a substantial office, employing a significant number of people,” in the host State
constituted an investment).

‘8 Counter-Memorial, para. 50. Apotex did suggest at one point in its written submissions that its relationship with
its U.S. affiliate, agent and distributor (Apotex Corp.) also independently qualified as “an interest in an enterprise
that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise” for the purposes of NAFTA Art 1139(e), and
so qualified as an “investment”. This point, however, was neither developed in writing, nor mentioned in oral
submissions, and the Tribunal is unpersuaded by it. There was no evidence that Apotex Corp was an “investment”
of Apotex, or that Apotex had an interest in it, such as to satisfy NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

Page 76 of 120

240.

241.

242.

more than purchases from U.S. suppliers by way of a “commercial contract for the sale of
goods” which are generally excluded by NAFTA Article 1139(i). In the words of the
Bayview tribunal (applying NAFTA Article 1139(i)):

“[t]he economic dependence of an enterprise upon supplies of goods ...
from another State is not sufficient to make the dependent enterprise an
‘investor’ in that other State.”!”

Consent to U.S. Jurisdiction / Legal Fees: Apotex’s submission to U.S. jurisdiction; its
engagement of U.S. attorneys; and its expenditure on legal fees again neither amount to
“investments”, nor change the nature of Apotex’s activity. Each is, again, no more than an
incident of the regulatory requirements of the U.S. market, and a step Apotex took in order

to facilitate its export business. NAFTA Article 1139(i) once again applies.

Overall Conclusion on “Investment”: It follows from the Tribunal’s conclusions above
that no “investment” has been made by Apotex in the territory of the United States, within

the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

(b) “Investor”

Having concluded that Apotex has made no “investment” in the territory of the United
States within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, it necessarily follows that Apotex itself
does not qualify as an “investor” for these purposes. As noted above, the scope and
coverage of the protections of NAFTA Chapter Eleven extend to “investors” only to the
extent that they have made, or have sought to make, “investments” in the territory of

another NAFTA Party.

v. Conclusions

Apotex has failed to establish that it made or sought to make an “investment” in the United

States. It therefore does not qualify as an “investor” under NAFTA Article 1116.

Apotex’s activities with respect to the contemplated sales of its sertraline and pravastatin
products in the United States are those of an exporter, not an investor. As such, the
position is analogous to that in Grand River Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, where the

tribunal found that:

“claimants activities centered on the manufacture of cigarettes at Grand
River’s manufacturing plant in Canada for export to the United States,”

and, as a result, determined that:

“such activities and investments by investors in the territory of one NAFTA
party do not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements for a claim against
another NAFTA party.”!!°

Apotex, like any company that intends to export generic drug products to the United States
for sale in the U.S. market, sought regulatory approval from the FDA through the
submission of ANDAs. But this process cannot change the nature of the underlying
activity, or constitute an “investment” in and of itself, within the meaning and scope of

NAFTA Article 1139.

It follows that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Apotex’s claims, which must be

dismissed in their entirety.

This is a complete answer to all of Apotex’s claims in both cases before this Arbitral
Tribunal, such that, strictly, there is no need for the Arbitral Tribunal to consider the

Respondent’s two remaining objections. However, since each of the remaining objections

was the subject of detailed written and oral argument, the Arbitral Tribunal considers it

appropriate to address them.

JUDICIAL FINALITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRAVASTATIN CLAIM

i. Respondent’s Position

As summarised in Section IV above, in both its Sertraline and Pravastatin Claims, Apotex

alleges that it suffered harm as a result of certain acts of (inter alia) U.S. Federal Courts.

With respect to its Sertraline Claim, Apotex sought, and was denied, review from the U.S.
Supreme Court with regard to the lower court decisions rejecting its declaratory judgment

action. All avenues of recourse within the U.S. court system were thereby exhausted.

With respect to its Pravastatin Claim, however, Apotex elected not to pursue all potentially
available avenues before the U.S. Courts. In particular, it did not seek U.S. Supreme Court
review of the court decisions rejecting its efforts to enjoin application of the FDA decision.
On the contrary, Apotex voluntarily dismissed with prejudice most of its claims in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia, after it lost its bid for preliminary injunctive
relief, and has not brought any remaining claims in court (See Apotex Inc. v. FDA, No.

Civ. A. 06-027 (D.D.C., 3 Oct. 2006) (Dkt. No. 42, Stipulation of Dismissal)).

In outline,!!!

the Respondent argues that Apotex therefore failed to pursue available
remedies at the trial court level — let alone reach judicial finality with regard to its domestic

court remedies on appeal.

'! Further detail of the Respondent’s submissions is set out in the course of the Tribunal’s analysis below.

Page 79 of 120

252.

253.

254.

255.

256.

Given that the judicial acts which are now the subject of complaint in the Pravatstain Claim
are not final, the Respondent submits that none can be the basis for claims under NAFTA

Chapter Eleven.

ii. Apotex’s Position

It is Apotex’s case that it has satisfied the requirement of finality for its Pravastatin Claim,

even under the standard advocated by the Respondent.

The Respondent argues that, after the appellate court granted summary affirmance
rejecting Apotex’s request for injunctive relief on 6 June 2006, and subsequently denied

Apotex’s petition for rehearing en banc on 17 August 2006, Apotex should have:

(a) petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari; and/or

(b) continued to proceed in litigating the case at the District Court level (on a non-

expedited basis) instead of voluntarily dismissing its claim upon remand.

According to Apotex, however, and in outline only,'!? given the timing of the D.C.
Circuit’s order denying Apotex’s petition for rehearing en banc, it would have been

“obviously futile” for Apotex to pursue either one of these actions.

Apotex’s application for rehearing en banc was denied on 17 August 2006. In light of the
D.C. Circuit’s order, and the fact that Teva’s exclusivity for pravastatin would expire well
before Apotex’s suit could be resolved on the merits, Apotex was justified in voluntarily

dismissing its claim.

'? Further detail of Apotex’s submissions is set out in the course of the Tribunal’s analysis in the following section.

iii. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Nature of this Objection: As explained in more detail below, this objection
has been argued by both Parties on the basis of an agreed basic principle, namely that any
claim under NAFTA which is based upon a judicial act, is subject to a requirement that all
judicial remedies within the host State first be exhausted. In other words, both sides have
proceeded upon a common assumption (a) that “judicial finality” must first be reached in
the host State’s domestic courts, (b) unless such recourse is “obviously futile”.''> The
Parties have differed, however, on the precise calibration of the “obviously futile”

exception.

At the outset of the oral hearing, the Tribunal questioned the proper characterisation of this
objection, and in particular whether it raised an issue of jurisdiction or admissibility, or
whether it might also be viewed as a preliminary substantive objection.''* This is a debate

with a long heritage as a matter of international law, and long-divided views.''*

However, from the inception of these proceedings, both Parties have treated this objection
as one of jurisdiction. This was then clarified in oral submissions by Counsel for the

Respondent, as the objecting Party, as follows:

“First, the United States agrees that the principle of finality in this case is
distinct from the general international law rule of the exhaustion of local
remedies, which the President has characterized as a procedural rule. The
exhaustion rule does not apply as a precondition to bringing a claim under
Chapter Eleven where the claim is based on a final Government act. In other

''3 This is an assumption that has been challenged by some commentators. See e.g., McLachlan Shore & Weiniger,
International Investment Arbitration (OUP 2007), at paras. 7.87 - 7.98, who criticise the reasoning in Loewen, and
argue that the customary international law rule on the exhaustion of local remedies has no role to play in the
different / hybrid context of investor-State arbitration. Given both Parties’ approach in this case, and both Parties’
heavy reliance on Loewen (see below), this wider debate was not engaged here.

words, a ‘measure’ that has been, ‘adopted or maintained’ pursuant to
Article 1101.

Second, as we explained yesterday, the United States position is that under
Article 1101, the act of a domestic court cannot constitute a measure that
has been adopted or maintained by the State, unless the Claimant has
exhausted all his judicial appeals. This interpretation derives from the rule
of finality in international law under which, ‘an act of a domestic court that
remains subject to appeal has not ripened into the type of final act that is
sufficiently definite to implicate State responsibility unless such recourse is
obviously futile.’ | quote from the Parties’ submissions.

Thus, it is the United States’ position that Apotex has no basis in the
NAFTA for challenging non-final judicial acts as breaches of Articles 1102,
1105, and 1110, unless they can show that final appeal would have been
obviously futile. To support a Chapter Eleven claim, the judicial acts
complained of must be final. In our view, this is a question of jurisdiction
ratione materiae, a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, because it goes
to whether the Tribunal may consider a claim based on a non-final judicial
act. But, whether the Tribunal chooses to characterize it as a question of
ripeness, of admissibility, or of jurisdiction, the outcome in this case is the
same: The claim should be dismissed because Claimants failed to seek
appeal to the Supreme Court. In the United States’ view, if the Tribunal
characterizes the finality requirement as an issue of admissibility, this does
not compel it to defer decision on it, as Claimant suggested yesterday. Even
an authority such as Judge Fitzmaurice who considers finality a question
related to the merits treats it as a ‘preliminary objection.’ Thus, it is entirely
proper to consider finality as ‘a preliminary question,’ under Article 21(4)
of the UNCITRAL Rules, along with the issues of investment and time bar.
We believe there is no dispute about the nature of investment in time bar as
jurisdictional questions.

In other words, whether characterized as admissibility or ripeness or
jurisdiction, the question whether Apotex can properly state a claim that
non-final judicial acts violated the NAFTA is a threshold issue. It should be
decided by the Tribunal as a matter of sound judicial economy. Both Apotex
and the United States have presented rounds of briefs and evidence on the
matter and have argued it before the Tribunal. The question is now ready for
decision by the Tribunal.”!'®

264.

In line with both Parties’ approach, the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that this objection
concerns the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae. In the alternative, the Tribunal has

also considered the matter in terms of the admissibility of claims.

Relevant Chronology: It is clear, as a matter of fact, that two further avenues of
recourse within the U.S. judicial system were available to Apotex, and that Apotex elected

not to pursue them.

First, Apotex never sought review in the U.S. Supreme Court of the pravastatin-related
decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals. In fact, none of the pravastatin-related judicial
acts now relied upon by Apotex as breaching U.S. obligations under the NAFTA was

finally reviewed within the U.S. judicial system.

Second, Apotex voluntarily agreed to the dismissal of its entire pravastatin claim in the
U.S. courts, most of which was dismissed with prejudice, instead of proceeding at the

District Court level.

It is useful here to re-cap the (somewhat complex) procedural history behind the

Pravastatin Claim, as set out in Section IV above:

(a) In Teva v. FDA, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
remanded the case to the District Court of the District of Columbia to vacate the
FDA’s first pravastatin letter decision of 28 June 2005.''’ Apotex, which was a
party to the Teva v. FDA matter, did not file a petition for certiorari with the U.S.
Supreme Court in that case, opting instead to file (on 5 April 2006) its own
complaint in Apotex v. FDA in the District Court for the District of Columbia,

along with a motion for a temporary restraining order. |'*

After the FDA issued its 11 April 2006 letter decision (which found that the
Apotex / BMS voluntary dismissal did not trigger the 180-day exclusivity period),
Apotex re-filed its motion seeking a preliminary injunction as well as a temporary
restraining order. Specifically, Apotex sought an order requiring the FDA to set
aside its 11 April 2006 letter decision and temporarily enjoining the award of any
180-day exclusivity for pravastatin ANDAs. The proposed injunction also would
have prevented the FDA from granting final approval of any pravastatin ANDAs
pending final approval of Apotex’s ANDA or resolution of Apotex’s challenge to
the FDA decision.'!”

opportunity to consider the merits of the motion for injunctive
relief pending appeal.” !™*

On 24 April 2006, the Court of Appeals dissolved the administrative injunction
and denied Apotex’s motion for injunctive relief pending appeal for failure to

“satsif[y] the stringent standards for an injunction pending appeal.” '?>
On 18 May 2006, Apotex filed a motion to expedite consideration of its appeal. 126

On 6 June 2006, the Court of Appeals granted Teva’s motion for summary
affirmance, finding that Apotex had “Vittle likelihood of succeeding on the merits

of its claims” and remanding to the District Court for further proceedings. |?”

Apotex then filed a petition to the Court of Appeals for rehearing en banc on 21
July 2006, which was denied on 17 August 2006.'*

Following the denial of its en banc petition, Apotex did not seek review by the

U.S. Supreme Court.

Furthermore, following the remand of its case to the District Court, rather than
pursuing a decision on the merits in court, Apotex stipulated to the dismissal of

the claim. By stipulation with the FDA, Apotex agreed to the dismissal of:

“all claims regarding pravastatin sodium tablets 10 mg, 20 mg, and
40 mg with prejudice, without costs to any party”

and

“all claims regarding pravastatin sodium tablets 80 mg without
prejudice, without costs to any party.”!”°

This was therefore a different situation to the Sertraline Claim—where Apotex sought, and
was denied, a writ of certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court with regard to the lower court

decisions dismissing its declaratory judgment action.

Also unlike the Sertraline Claim, Apotex subsequently failed to pursue its claim even in the

District Court, opting instead to agree to its dismissal.

Stated thus, the judicial acts now challenged by Apotex in its Pravastatin Claim do not
appear as “final” manifestations of justice within the U.S. judicial system such as to allow

for international law claims — because Apotex still had other options to pursue.

The key issue is therefore the basis upon which Apotex elected not to exhaust all available
remedies, and whether such remedies were (according to the Parties’ common test)

“obviously futile”.

Application to the U.S. Supreme Court: Apotex explains that after the FDA issued
its letter decision on 11 April 2006 (refusing to treat the BMS - Apotex dismissal as a
triggering court decision), Apotex promptly sought injunctive relief from the District
Court. After the D.C. District Court denied Apotex’s motion, the FDA then approved
Teva’s ANDA on 24 April 2006.'"° Teva immediately launched its respective ANDA

products, thereby triggering the 180-day exclusivity period, which would expire on 23
October 2006. Apotex immediately appealed the District Court’s decision and Teva

moved for summary affirmance.

As already noted, on 6 June 2006, the D.C. Circuit summarily affirmed the District Court’s
decision on Apotex’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Apotex petitioned for rehearing
of that decision, which the D.C. Circuit denied on 17 August 2006. At that point, the case
returned to the D.C. District Court for further proceedings on the merits, on a non-

expedited basis.

The core point, as far as Apotex is concerned, is that once its petition for rehearing en banc
was denied, only 67 days remained of Teva’s 180-day exclusivity period. After this period
expired (i.e., on 23 October 2006), Apotex would then be eligible for final approval of its

pravastatin ANDA - regardless of the outcome of its case.'*!

Moreover, even if Apotex had eventually succeeded on the merits on or after that date,
Apotex would not have been entitled to damages from the FDA, or any other party for that
matter. Thus, once the 180-day exclusivity period had expired, Apotex would no longer be

able to obtain any meaningful or effective relief from either the FDA or the Courts.

Therefore, against these facts, Apotex submits that it should not have been required to
petition for certiorari requesting expedited relief to overturn the D.C. Circuit’s summary
affirmance — particularly given that the decision by the D.C. Circuit Court related solely to

Apotex’s request for injunctive relief, and was not a full decision on the merits.

Further, Apotex submits that it is wholly unrealistic to suppose that the Supreme Court

would not only have granted the petition, but could have scheduled argument and render an

opinion in Apotex’s favour within 67 days. Any efforts to achieve such a result would

have been “objectively futile”.

275. Had Apotex immediately petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari, under the relevant
U.S. Supreme Court rules, the FDA would have had 30 days from the date the case was
docketed to submit a response, after which Apotex would have had an additional 10 days

to reply.

Thus, Apotex argues that the Supreme Court Clerk could not even have
distributed Apotex’s petition to the Supreme Court until less than a month was left in
Teva’s exclusivity period.'™* Thus, the Court would not have granted the petition, ordered
briefing and a hearing, and decided the matter at any time before 23 October 2006, when

the relief requested would have been rendered moot.

276. The Tribunal has sympathy for Apotex’s position, and can readily appreciate that a
judgment call was taken at the time that petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court was unlikely
to secure the desired relief. However, as the Respondent has observed, under established
principles, the question whether the failure to obtain judicial finality may be excused for
“obvious futility” turns on the unavailability of relief by a higher judicial authority, not on
measuring the likelihood that the higher judicial authority would have granted the desired
relief. In this case, and on balance, the Tribunal is not satisfied that finality was achieved,
such as to allow for a claim under NAFTA in respect of the particular judicial decisions in

question.

'S2 According to the U.S. Supreme Court’s website, as cited by Apotex, “The Court receives approximately 10,000

petitions for a writ of certiorari each year. The Court grants and hears oral argument in about 75-80 cases.”
Supreme Court of the United States, Frequently Asked Questions, taken from
http://www.supremecourt.gov/faq.aspx [C58]. Further, Apotex cites Aaron-Andrew P. Bruhl, The Supreme Court's
Controversial GVRS — And An Alternative, 107 Mich. L. Rev. 711, 745 (Mar. 2009) [C59]: “/iJhe average time

time of year.”

The starting point is to recall the very serious nature of the allegations against the U.S.
judicial system in Apotex’s Pravastatin Claim. Apotex asserts that the U.S. District Court
for the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit,
administered justice so deficiently as to violate Apotex’s rights under the U.S.
Constitution, and to put the United States in breach of its international law obligations
under the NAFTA. Yet, at the same time (and notwithstanding the gravity of the alleged
breaches), Apotex elected not to allow the U.S. Supreme Court all possible opportunities to
correct the alleged errors and transgressions. Instead, Apotex now requests that this
Tribunal — in effect — substitute itself for the U.S. Supreme Court, and sit as a supranational
appellate court, to review the judicial decisions of lower U.S. courts. The Tribunal

declines to do so, for three reasons.

First, as a general proposition, it is not the proper role of an international tribunal
established under NAFTA Chapter Eleven to substitute itself for the U.S. Supreme Court,
or to act as a supranational appellate court. This has been repeatedly emphasised in

previous decisions. For example:
(a) Mondev Award, at paragraph 126:'*°

“Under NAFTA, parties have the option to seek local remedies. If
they do so and lose on the merits, it is not the function of NAFTA
tribunals to act as courts of appeal.”

(b) Azinian Award, at paragraph 99:'°°

“The possibility of holding a State internationally liable for judicial
decisions does not, however, entitle a claimant to seek international
review of the national court decisions as though the international
jurisdiction seised has plenary appellate jurisdiction. This is not
true generally, and it is not true for NAFTA.”

186 Azinian vy. United Mexican States, NAFTA/ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award (1 Nov. 1999).

Page 89 of 120

(c) Waste Management Award, at paragraph 129:'°7

“Turning to the actual reasons given by the federal courts, the
Tribunal would observe that it is not a further court of appeal, nor
is Chapter 11 of NAFTA a novel form of amparo in respect of the
decisions of the federal courts of NAFTA parties.”

279. Second, and related to this, the “obvious futility” threshold is a high one. This

necessarily follows from the nature of the rule to which it is an exception.

280. The requirement that local judicial remedies be exhausted before judicial acts may
found an international complaint was said by both Parties to flow from two
sources: (a) NAFTA Article 1101, by which any impugned act must be a
“measure adopted or maintained” by the host State (and the proposition that a
judicial act is not a measure adopted or maintained by the State unless “final”);
and (b) customary international law, as applicable by virtue of NAFTA Article
1131, which provides that:

“A tribunal established under this section shall decide the issues in dispute
in accordance with this agreement and applicable rules of international law.”

281.

As a matter of customary international law, both Parties asserted that an act of a
domestic court that remains subject to appeal has not ripened into the type of final
act that is sufficiently definite to implicate State responsibility - unless such

recourse is obviously futile. As summarised on behalf of the Respondent:

“The finality requirement is fundamental to claims that may result in
holding a State’s Judiciary in violation of international law. National
judicial systems including those of the three NAFTA Parties, provide for
higher courts to correct errors below. Decisions by higher courts harmonise
the interpretation and application of the law by lower courts. A finding by
an International Tribunal such as this one, that national courts violated

‘57 Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States, NAFTA/ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award (30 Apr.
2004).

Page 90 of 120

international law implicates a systemic failure of the national judiciary.
International law recognises, therefore, that the national court system must
be given a chance to correct errors.” **

282. Although both Parties asserted that this rule applies to all causes of action

premised upon judicial acts, both Parties primarily invoked authorities concerning

139

denial of justice claims. Such claims depend upon the demonstration of a

systemic failure in the judicial system. Hence, a claimant cannot raise a claim that
a judicial act constitutes a breach of international law, without first proceeding
through the judicial system that it purports to challenge, and thereby allowing the
system an opportunity to correct itself. In the words of Jan Paulsson, Denial of

Justice in International Law 108 (2005):

“For a foreigner’s international grievance to proceed as a claim of denial of
justice, the national system must have been tested. Its perceived failings
cannot constitute an international wrong unless it has been given a chance to
correct itself.”

And as stated in Loewen Group v. United States:

“The purpose of the requirement that a decision of a lower court be
challenged through the judicial process before the State is responsible for a
breach of international law constituted by judicial decision is to afford the
State the opportunity of redressing through its legal system the inchoate
breach of international law occasioned by the lower court decision.”'”°

'8§ Transcript, Day 1, pages 162-3.

'° There is a live issue in the context of NAFTA as to whether the “finality” rule, or the requirement that
local judicial remedies be exhausted, applies to any claim arising out of a judicial act, or merely “denial of
justice” claims (or claims within the category of FET). This issue, however, was not pursued by the Parties
in this case. Instead, both Parties relied upon the analysis in The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.
Loewen v. United States of America, \CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award (26 June 2003), in which the
obligation to exhaust local remedies in a case in which the alleged violation of international law is founded
upon a judicial act was applied to claims under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1110 as well as Article 1105 (see
Loewen, Award, para. 165, by reference, inter alia, to The Finnish Ships Arbitration Award, 3 R. INT’L
ARB. AWARDS 1480, 1495, 1503-05 (9 May 1934) and Nielsen v. Denmark [1958-1959] Y.B. EUR.
COMM’N HLR. 412 at 436, 438, 440, 444).

‘9 Toewen, Award, para. 156. The same basic principle has a long and broader heritage. See e.g., Edwin M.
Borchard, The Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad 198 (1915) (“It is a fundamental principle that

Page 91 of 120

283. Importantly, this principle was emphasised and relied upon in terms by Apotex in this case
(to support its argument that none of its claims are time barred under NAFTA Article

1116(2) - see Section V(d) below). In Apotex’s own words: '4!

“71, Under Chapter Eleven of NAFTA, before an action by an agent
of a State may be elevated to a breach that implicates State responsibility, it
must be considered a ‘measure[ ] adopted and maintained by a Party.’'*? In
other words, as explained over a century ago in the decisions of the United
States-Mexican Claims Tribunal, a Respondent may not ‘be made
responsible for the [conduct of a judicial office] when no attempt . . . has
been made to obtain justice from a higher court.’'*?

72. Respondent has consistently maintained, and indeed prevailed on,
this very position in other NAFTA Chapter Eleven proceedings. For
example, before the Loewen Tribunal, where the Respondent United States
also attempted to dismiss a NAFTA arbitration claim based upon alleged
jurisdictional deficiencies, the Respondent argued that, under NAFTA and
well-recognized principles of international law, ‘judicial action is a single
action from beginning to end so that the State has not spoken (and therefore
no liability arises) until all appeals have been exhausted, or any such
appeals would be obviously futile.'** The Loewen Tribunal agreed, stating:

No instance has been drawn to our attention in which an
international tribunal has held a State responsible for a breach of
international law constituted by a lower court decision when

 

[with respect to acts of the judiciary] . . . only the highest court to which a case is appealable may be
considered an authority involving the responsibility of the state.”), League of Nations Publications, Bases of
Discussion, Vol. III Responsibility of States 41-51 (1920) (“Jt is not disputed that the courts are able to
involve the State in responsibility, but the judicial decision with which it is confronted must be final and
without appeal.”)

there was available an effective and adequate appeal within the
State’s legal system. '*°

723. The principles under international law mandate that a claimant
must exhaust its ‘local remedies’ prior to holding the State accountable for a
breach of its obligations.'*° As the Loewen Tribunal aptly noted, the reason
claimants are required to exhaust local remedies before a State can be held
responsible under international law ‘is to afford the State the opportunity of
redressing through its legal system the inchoate breach of international law
occasioned by the lower court decision. The requirement has application to
breaches of [NAFTA] Articles 1102 and 1110 as well as Article 1105.””!*7

284. Because each judicial system must be allowed to correct itself, the “obvious finality”
exception must be construed narrowly. It requires an actual unavailability of recourse, or

7148

recourse that is proven to be “manifestly ineffective”’"* — which, in turn, requires more than

one side simply proffering its best estimate or prediction as to its likely prospects of

success, if available recourse had been pursued. '*?

285. It is not enough, therefore, to allege the “absence of a reasonable prospect of success or

the improbability of success, which are both less strict tests.”'~ In the (frequently quoted)

words of Professor Borchard, a claimant is not:

“relieved from exhausting his local remedies by alleging ... a pretended
impossibility or uselessness of action before the local courts.”!

art 15, para. 3). This, of course, was in the context of the general principle as to exhaustion of local remedies in

customary international law, as opposed to the more specific rule regarding judicial acts and “finality” in issue here.

288.

To give some flavour to the threshold, the Respondent has emphasised that where
international tribunals have found “obvious futility”, they have tended to do so because

there “was no justice to exhaust.” By way of example (as relied upon by the Respondent):

(a) The Finnish Ships Arbitration Award (Finland v. U.K.) (9 May 1934): rule
excusing failure to appeal where reversal was “hopeless” is “most strictly
construed, and if substantial right of appeal existed, failure to prosecute an

appeal operated as a bar to relief’;'*

(b) Robert E. Brown Case (U.S. v. U.K.) (23 Nov. 1923): excusing claimant’s failure
to exhaust because there was “no justice to exhaust” where “[a]ll three branches

of the Government conspired to ruin [claimant's] enterprise”.'*>

Third, on the facts of this case, even if the chance of the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to
hear Apotex’s case was remote, the availability of a remedy was certain. Pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1254(1), Apotex could have sought U.S. Supreme Court review on an expedited
basis of the Court of Appeals decision on injunctive relief, even after its petition for

rehearing en banc was denied.'**

As against this, Apotex submits that because the chances of a successful outcome were
“unrealistic”, a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court was “objectively futile”,'° or to be
treated as if unavailable. In effect, the Tribunal is being asked to determine the likelihood

of a successful result before the U.S. Supreme Court — which the Tribunal does not

consider is its proper task, or indeed the correct enquiry. In the words of Judge

. . 5
Lauterpacht, in Norwegian Loans case: 186

“[H]owever contingent and theoretical these remedies may be, an attempt
ought to have been made to exhaust them.”

289. Equally, the consequence of Apotex’s submission as to its chances of success before the
U.S. Supreme Court (based in part on the small number of cases that this Court entertains
each year) would be, in effect, to write the U.S. Supreme Court out of the exhaustion of

remedies rule in almost all cases. This cannot be correct.

290. Even if (for the sake of completeness) the Tribunal was to embark on a prediction as to the
likely ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court, had it been asked to rule, there are number of

factors that undermine Apotex’s position:

(a) Apotex asserts that seeking certiorari on its pravastatin claim would have been
“absurd”, because the D.C. Circuit’s decision “related solely to Apotex’s request
for injunctive relief, and was not a decision on the merits.”'*" In so far as this is
intended to imply that the U.S. Supreme Court does not hear cases relating only to
procedural matters, this is obviously not so: the U.S. Supreme Court has the
power to hear cases that relate only to preliminary procedural issues,!** and

(importantly) to issue stays.'*? Apotex simply failed to seek any such relief here.

'8 Federal Practice & Procedure § 4036 (2011) (stating that, with regard to 28 U.S.C. § 1254(1), “[e]ven more
dramatic illustration of the lack of technical restrictions is provided by contrasting certiorari to the courts of appeals
with certiorari to state courts. The greatest opportunity for imposing technicalistic difficulties is presented by the
statutory requirement that the case be “in” the court of appeals, but no genuine obstacle has in fact resulted. Beyond
that starting point, there is no requirement that there be a ‘final’ decision; once a case has come to be in a court of
appeals, the Supreme Court may grant certiorari to review interlocutory decisions or procedural rulings, and may
even grant review before the court of appeals has taken any action at all.”) (Emphasis added) [R90].

maintain the status quo. U.S. Sup. Ct. R. 22, 23 (2006) [R91].

(b) Apotex appears to have (in the Respondent’s words) “run out the litigation
clock’. As such, it cannot now claim insufficient time to pursue further remedies.
Apotex claims to have “promptly” sought injunctive relief from the District Court

on its pravastatin claim,'°

and to have “immediately” appealed the District
Court’s decision denying that relief.'*' But (as the Respondent has pointed out)
when the D.C. Circuit, on 24 April 2006, dissolved the administrative injunction
temporarily staying the FDA’s approval of any pravastatin ANDAs, Apotex then
waited 24 days before seeking expedited consideration (a simple 14-page

: 2
motion). 12

The D.C. Circuit rendered its decision in just under three weeks (6
June 2006) — well ahead of Apotex’s proposed schedule.'®> Apotex could then
have immediately petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court (i.e. as of 7 June 2006, 138
days before the end of Teva’s exclusivity period). Apotex elected not to do so,
but instead chose to petition the D.C. Circuit for en banc rehearing.' And yet
Apotex then took 44 of 45 allotted days to file a 15-page petition for rehearing en
banc'®*—a motion that, according to the Respondent, was not required in any
event in order to seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court (or, indeed, to pursue
claims on the merits in the District Court.) After the D.C. Circuit denied
Apotex’s en banc petition, Apotex still had 67 days to seek certiorari (or, indeed,
other relief, such as a stay), before the 180-day market exclusivity expired.
Overall, as the Respondent has noted, Apotex spent a total of 135 days of the 180-

day exclusivity period “not advancing its claim in court”. The timing difficulty,

therefore, was in large part a consequence of Apotex’s own litigation strategy. As

stated in the Ambatielos Case (Greece v. U.K.), at 122 (6 Mar 1956):

“Tt would be wrong to hold that a party who, by failing to exhaust
his opportunities in the Court of first instance, has caused an appeal
to become futile should be allowed to rely on this fact in order to
rid himself of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies.” '

Pursuing the Claim at District Court Level: As to the Respondent’s argument
that Apotex should have pressed onward with its claim at the District Court level, Apotex
submits that the D.C. District Court had already denied Apotex’s request for emergency
relief, which the D.C. Circuit affirmed on appeal. Thus, at the District Court level, Apotex
would have been forced to proceed at the standard litigation pace, as expedited relief was
no longer an option.

On remand, the District Court scheduled a status hearing to be held on 6 October 2006.'°7
On 3 October 2006, a mere 20 days before Teva’s exclusivity period expired, Apotex
voluntarily dismissed its suit.'°° According to Apotex, even if it had immediately filed a
summary judgment motion after the 6 October 2006 status conference, under the local
tules of that District Court, the time permitted to fully brief the matter would have

extended beyond the date the issue became moot on 23 October 2006.'°

Once again, however, the Tribunal does not consider that Apotex has met the “obvious

futility” exception here.

294. The Tribunal is not persuaded that pursuing substantive relief on remand would have been
“absurd”, because Apotex “would have been forced to proceed at standard litigation pace,
as expedited relief was no longer an option.”'”° Just as Apotex had sought expedited
consideration of its appeal (on the interlocutory issue) before the D.C. Circuit, it remains
unclear why it could not have sought expedited consideration of its claim on the merits

before the D.C. District Court.'”! On any view, it made no attempt to do so.

295. Further, after the D.C. Circuit rejected Apotex’s petition for rehearing en banc on 17
August 2006, Apotex waited 47 days (until 3 October 2006) before voluntarily dismissing

all of its claims against the FDA.'”

296. Further still, as is clear from its Stipulation of Dismissal, Apotex dismissed all claims
“with prejudice” for 10, 20, and 40 mg strengths, but “without prejudice” for the 80 mg
strength. As the Respondent notes, the 180-day exclusivity period for 80 mg generic
pravastatin had not yet begun to run, because Ranbaxy (the company that had been
awarded the 180-day exclusivity for 80 mg generic pravastatin) had not yet launched that
strength.' Ranbaxy did not in fact do so until 25 June 2007.' Importantly, Apotex
preserved its ability to continue litigating before the District Court with respect to 80 mg

pravastatin — but it never did.

“good cause’ is shown if a right under the Constitution of the United States or a Federal Statute . . . would be
maintained in a factual context that indicates that a request for expedited consideration has merit.”) As the
Respondent notes, under the Local Civil Rules of the D.C. District Court, Rule 16.1(a) permits the judge assigned to
the case to determine the schedule accordingly [R94].

Apotex has sought to rebut this point, on the basis that once Teva’s exclusivity period had
expired for all other strengths, Apotex’s ability to obtain effective relief expired with it,
and that “the damage to the generic pravastatin market had been done”. The Tribunal,
however, remains unpersuaded on Apotex’s reply, which was neither properly developed

as a submission, nor supported by any evidence.

iv. Conclusion

It follows that, even if Apotex did qualify as an “investor”, who has made an “investment”
in the U.S. for the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139, all claims within Apotex’s
Pravastatin Claim that the judicial acts of the D.C. District Court and the D.C. Circuit
breached Articles 1102, 1105, and 1110 of the NAFTA would fall to be dismissed in any
event, on the additional basis that Apotex has failed to exhaust all local judicial remedies,

and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae.

In the alternative, and for the same reasons, all such claims would be inadmissible in any

event.

THE NAFTA TIME BAR

i. Relevant Provisions of NAFTA

NAFTA Article 1116(2) provides that:

“An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed
from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first
acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor
has incurred loss or damage.”

Page 99 of 120

301.

302.

303.

304.

305.

As explained by the Tribunal in Feldman v. United Mexican States, the term “making a

175 For a claim

claim” refers to the “definitive activation of an arbitration procedure.
brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, NAFTA Article 1137(1)(c) defines the
relevant time as the date on which the Notice of Arbitration “is received by the disputing

Party.”

Accordingly, Article 1116(2) requires a claimant to submit, and for the NAFTA Party to
receive, a Notice of Arbitration within three years of the date on which the claimant first
acquired knowledge, either actual or constructive, of the alleged breach and of the alleged

loss or damage.

Knowledge of loss or damage incurred by the investor under Article 1116(2) does not,

however, require knowledge of the extent of loss or damage.'7°

In both Grand River v. United States and Feldman v. United Mexican States, NAFTA
Chapter Eleven tribunals described the three-year limitation period as a “clear and rigid”
defence, and noted that the time limitation is “not subject to any suspension, prolongation

or other qualification.”'””

ii. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent received Apotex’s Notice of Arbitration in the Sertraline Claim, dated 10
December 2008, on 11 December 2008, and Apotex’s Notice of Arbitration in the
Pravastatin claim, dated 4 June 2009, on 5 June 2009.

311.

The Respondent initially raised time bar objections to both the Sertraline and Pravastatin

Claims.

In relation to the Sertraline Claim, the Respondent objected to Apotex’s allegation in its
Sertraline Notice of Arbitration!” that the 3 January 2005 decision of the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York in Apotex, Inc. v. Pfizer Inc. was
“tantamount to a denial of justice as defined by international law and constitutes an
expropriation of Apotex’s investment” (to the extent that it was alleged that a breach and

loss occurred at that time).

However, in the course of its written submissions, this objection was dropped, and the

Respondent then focused exclusively upon the Pravastatin Claim.!”

In outline, *°

the Respondent submits, that the time bar precludes Apotex’s allegation in its
Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration that the FDA’s letter decision of 11 April 2006
(determining that the 180-day exclusivity period had not been triggered) itself constituted a

violation of Articles 1102, 1105, and 1110 of the NAFTA. '*!

The FDA decision was administrative in nature, and so not subject to any duty to exhaust
judicial remedies. Critically, it occurred more than three years before Apotex brought its

Pravastatin Claim under the NAFTA, and it is therefore time-barred.

Although Apotex seeks to toll the limitation period by linking the FDA measure to later

court actions, NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunals have consistently rejected such efforts as

"8 Sertraline Notice of Arbitration, para. 50.

™ See Respondent’s Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction of Respondent United States of America, dated 17 Oct.
2011, at paras. 8 & 40-54. The Respondent ultimately accepted that Apotex’s Sertraline Claim was not time-barred,
given Apotex’s clarification in its Counter-Memorial (para. 68) that its denial of justice claim did not rest on the 3
Jan. 2005 District Court decision alone, but rather “. . . the actions of at least three U.S. federal courts, including the
New York District Court, the Federal Circuit, and the Supreme Court[.]”

'89 Further detail of the Respondent’s submissions is set out in the course of the Tribunal’s analysis below.

'S! Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration, para. 67.

Page 101 of 120

contrary to the plain language of the agreement. The FDA measure thus falls outside the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

 

Apotex’s Position
312. It is Apotex’s case that all elements of its Pravastatin Claim were timely submitted.
313. In outline,'** Apotex argues that:

(a) Contrary to the Respondent’s analysis, there is no “hard-and-fast” cut-off date
under NAFTA, such that any issues that arose prior thereto must be completely

ignored.

(b) The limitation rule in NAFTA Article 1116(2) includes two separate and distinct
components: (1) knowledge of the breach; and (2) knowledge that the investor has

incurred loss or damage. The three year period begins to run only after both of

these requirements have been met.'*?

(c) Under international law, as the Respondent itself asserts:

“{aJn act of a domestic court that remains subject to appeal has not
ripened into the type of final act that is sufficiently definite to
implicate state responsibility, unless such recourse is obviously
futile”!

'® Further detail of Apotex’s submissions is set out in the course of the Tribunal’s analysis below.

'S Citing, inter alia, Kinnear, Bjorklund & Hannaford, Investment Disputes Under NAFTA: An Annotated Guide to
NAFTA Chapter 11 at 1116-36b (July 2009) (“The investor must, however, acquire knowledge of both the breach
and the ensuing damage. The three-year limitation period presumably runs from the later of these events to occur in
the event that the knowledge of both events is not simultaneous”).

'S!U 5. Memorial, para. 61.

Page 102 of 120

(d) Apotex’s Pravastatin Claim consists of a “single, continuous set” of underlying
factual bases leading to the Respondent’s breach. It is based on the ruling by the
FDA that the dismissal of Apotex’s declaratory judgment action against the patent
owner failed to constitute a court decision trigger under the FFDCA, and the
subsequent actions by the D.C. District Court and the D.C. Circuit in denying
Apotex’s federal court challenge to that ruling.'** The underlying factual basis
for the claim, including the respective decisions made by the administrative and
judicial bodies of the United States challenged therein, cannot be parsed into

separate, unrelated events or “claims”, as the Respondent suggests.

(e) Further, the well-established “finality or futility’ requirement, under which a
complainant must exhaust its local remedies (unless obviously futile) prior to an
action being attributable to the State under international law, means that only after
such remedies are exhausted has a breach occurred, let alone “knowledge of the

alleged breach” as required under NAFTA Article 1116(2).

(f) The breaches serving as the basis for Apotex’s Pravastatin Claim, and Apotex’s
awareness of each breach, therefore occurred well within the three-year limitation

period.

iv. The Tribunal’s Analysis

314. The Nature of this Objection: As with the previous issue, there is an initial
question as to the precise nature of this objection, and whether it is properly characterised
as one of “jurisdiction” or merits / substance. The objection was treated by both Parties as
a “jurisdictional” issue. The Respondent, as the objecting Party, explained its position as

follows:

315. Analysis:

316.

“The Tribunal has asked whether the time-bar objection was an objection to
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. We submit that it is. As stated in NAFTA
Article 1122, the United States consented to investor-State arbitration under
Chapter Eleven in accordance with the procedures set out in this agreement.
The scope of the three NAFTA Parties’ consent is thus limited by the
procedures contained within Chapter Eleven. In that regard and as discussed
at length yesterday, Article 1116(2) prohibits an investor from making and
the Tribunal from hearing, ‘a claim if more than three years have elapsed
from the date on which the investor first acquired or should have first
acquired knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor
has incurred loss or damage.’ Article 1116(2), thus, contains a temporal
requirement for jurisdiction over the investor’s claim. It’s a jurisdictional
objection ratione temporis. Just as the United States does not consent to be
bound by obligations and treaties which are not in force, also an objection
ratione temporis, the United States did not consent to arbitrate NAFTA
Chapter Eleven claims that arise outside of the applicable three-year
limitations period. We believe the plain language of Article 1116(2) makes
this clear.

As further confirmation, the U.S. Statement of Administrative Action in
briefly discussing Articles 1116 and Article 1117 states simply that those
Articles require that, ‘all claims must be brought within three years.””'*°

2006 (i.e. three years before Apotex filed its Notice of Arbitration).

As set out in its Statement of Claims (and summarised in Section IV above), Apotex’s

Pravastatin Claim arises out of:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the decision of the FDA on 11 April 2006;

the subsequent denial of emergency injunctive relief seeking to overturn that

decision by the D.C. District Court on 19 April 2006;

the 6 June 2006 affirmation by the D.C. Circuit denying Apotex’s request for

emergency relief; and

'86 Transcript, Day 2, pages 313-315.

Page 104 of 120

In relation to the Pravastatin Claim, the relevant cut-off date is 5 June

317.

318.

319.

320.

(d) the 17 August 2006 denial of rehearing en banc by the same D.C. Court.

Tn the Tribunal’s view, a distinction must be drawn between:

(a) claims based upon the FDA decision itself; and

(b) claims based upon the 6 June 2006 and 17 August 2006 decisions of the D.C.
Circuit, which may entail reference to the earlier FDA and District Court

decisions.

Claims Based on the FDA Decision Itself: In so far as Apotex seeks to advance any
claim based exclusively on the FDA decision of 11 April 2006, this clearly falls outside of
the NAFTA three-year limitation period, and is therefore time-barred. In other words,
Apotex cannot now assert that the FDA decision constituted — in and of itself — a breach of

NAFTA Articles 1102, 1105, and 1110.

Contrary to Apotex’s subsequent submissions, this is a claim that was in fact pleaded in

terms in the Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration. '*”

It is clear that in April 2006 Apotex already had knowledge of the FDA measure and
knowledge of any resulting loss or damage allegedly arising from it. According to its own
pleading, Apotex’s inability to bring its pravastatin products to market in April 2006 (by
which time, in Apotex’s view, the market exclusivity period held by the first paragraph IV

applicants should have expired) caused Apotex “to suffer substantial damages.”'**

'87 Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration, para. 67.

'8§ Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration, paras. 50, 67; also para. 30: “Apotex was prevented from obtaining approval
and timely bringing its pravastatin tablets to market in April 2006, thus causing Apotex substantial injury including,
but not limited to, significant lost sales and lost market share.”

Page 105 of 120

321.

322.

323.

324.

325.

Apotex further alleges in its Statement of Claims that the ability of the first paragraph IV
applicants to launch their generic pravastatin products while enjoying market exclusivity in

April 2006 enabled those companies to “secur{e] a stranglehold over the market.”'*?

Apotex even pre-emptively challenged the FDA measure in court on 5 April 2006,
claiming that Apotex had been “adversely affected by final agency action and/or agency

action unlawfully withheld.”'°

And yet Apotex delayed submitting its Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration until 5 June 2009.
There is no obvious reason why Apotex could not have made its claims regarding the FDA
measure in a timely manner. The FDA decision was taken in April 2006. All U.S. litigation
over the measure ended in August 2006, and Apotex voluntarily dismissed all claims
relating to the measure in October 2006. Apotex then had ample time to bring its NAFTA
claim challenging the FDA decision. Indeed, Apotex brought its Sertraline Claim on 11
December 2008, which, had it included the Pravastatin Claim, would have been within the

required time limit.

Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s submission that by reason of NAFTA
Article 1116(2), all claims based exclusively upon the FDA decision of 11 April 2006 are

time-barred, and so must be dismissed.

Apotex cannot avoid this conclusion by asserting that the FDA measure is part of a
“continuing breach” by the United States, or “part of the same single, continuous action,”
in so far as this is intended as a mechanism to use later court proceedings to toll the

limitation period for the earlier FDA measure.

'89 Apotex’s Statement of Claims, para. 108.

1° Complaint, para. 10, in Apotex Inc. v. FDA, No. Civ. A.06-0627 (D.D.C. 5 Apr. 2006) (“Apotex has standing to
maintain this action, pursuant to the [Administrative Procedure Act], as a legal entity that has suffered a legal
wrong and has been adversely affected by final agency action and/or agency action unlawfully withheld.”) [R56].

328.

As the Respondent has forcefully argued, nothing in the text or jurisprudence of NAFTA
Chapter Eleven suggests that a party can evade NAFTA’s limitation period in this way.

On the contrary, the rule in NAFTA Article 1116(2) has been described as a:

“clear and rigid limitation defense, which . . . is not subject to any
suspension, prolongation or other qualification.” "!

Further, there is support in previous NAFTA decisions for the proposition that the
limitation period applicable to a discrete government or administrative measure (such as
the FDA decision of 11 April 2006) is not tolled by litigation, or court decisions relating to

the measure. For example:

(a) In Mondey, the tribunal rejected an attempt by the claimant to toll the limitation

‘At issue in that

period through a court action against the underlying measures.
case were actions of the City of Boston and the Boston Redevelopment Agency
(“BRA”) concerning the development of commercial real estate in Boston, as well
as subsequent litigation involving those actions. The tribunal declined to consider
actions of the City of Boston and the BRA, as those actions had arisen before 1
January 1994, when the NAFTA entered into force. Relevantly for present

purposes, the tribunal noted that:

“if Mondev’s claims concerning the conduct of the City and
BRA had been continuing NAFTA claims as at 1 January 1994,
they would now be time-barred.”

The Mondey tribunal thus limited its jurisdiction to claims concerning the

decisions of U.S. courts, as those claims:

'°! Grand River, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 29.

'2 Mondev, Award, para. 87 (11 Oct. 2002).

Page 107 of 120

“were commenced within three years from the final court
wos 9193
decisions.

(b) In Grand River, the claimants argued that the NAFTA’s limitation period applied
differently depending on when each U.S. state implemented an underlying

measure.'™ The tribunal found that claimants’ approach would:

“render the limitations provisions ineffective in any situation
involving a series of similar and related actions by a respondent
state, since a claimant would be free to base its claim on the
most recent transgression, even if it had knowledge of earlier
breaches and injuries.”

and that:

“{T]he Tribunal’s views parallel those of the NAFTA Tribunal
in Mondev. The claimant there also faced difficulties arising
from the time limitations of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2). The
claimant sought to surmount these with the argument that it
could have certain knowledge that it had incurred injury from
events prior to the limitations period only after it knew the
outcome of subsequent litigation that stood to quantify the
extent of loss was known. The Tribunal did not agree, finding
that ‘a Claimant may know that it has suffered loss or damage
even if the extent of quantification of the loss or damage is still
unclear.’”!°°

329. Apotex places much reliance upon the Loewen tribunal’s statement (quoting the U.S. as

respondent in that case) that:

'83 Td. (emphasis added).

' Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd. v. United States, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction
para. 81 (20 July 006) (Claimants “maintained that there is not one limitations period, but many”).

185 Td. para. 78 (quoting Monde, Award, para. 87).

Page 108 of 120

330.

331.

332.

333.

“judicial action is a single action from beginning to end so that the State has
not spoken (and therefore no liability arises) until all appeals have been
exhausted.”!”°

But this is of no application here, for the simple reason — as Apotex itself asserts elsewhere
— that the FDA measure in question is an “administrative decision”, not a “judicial

”*;!°7 that the FDA measure could have been the subject of a separate complaint

action
under the NAFTA"; and that the NAFTA does not require claimants to exhaust all

available remedies before challenging non-judicial decisions. '””

The position, therefore, is that any challenge to the FDA decision itself had to be brought
within three years, and could not be delayed by resort to court action. Any conclusion
otherwise would provide a very easy means to evade the clear rule in NAFTA Article

1116(2) in most cases (i.e. by filing any court action, however hopeless).

Whilst this provides the certainty and finality intended by NAFTA Article 1116(2), and
forces parties to initiate proceedings with respect to (as here) administrative decisions, it
obviously does not preclude the exercise of discretion on the part of NAFTA tribunals,
once constituted, to stay arbitral proceedings pending court proceedings, in appropriate

cases.

Claims Based on the 6 June & 17 August 2006 D.C. Decisions: Having so ruled, it
must be made clear that there is no time-bar difficulty with respect to Apotex’s claims

based upon the 6 June 2006 and 17 August 2006 decisions of the D.C. Circuit. And

clearly, any claim that these judicial decisions constituted a breach of the NAFTA would

require at least some consideration of the prior administrative and judicial decisions.”

But the two types of claim are clearly analytically distinct. One is a claim that a breach
occurred, and loss was incurred, as at 11 April 2006, by reason of the FDA’s
(administrative) ruling that the dismissal of Apotex’s declaratory judgment action against
the patent owner did not constitute a “court decision trigger”. The other is a claim that a
breach occurred, and loss was incurred, as at 6 June 2006, or alternatively 17 August 2006,

by reason of the (judicial) decisions of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

v. Conclusions

It follows that, even if Apotex qualified as an “investor”, who has made an “investment” in
the U.S. for the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139, the Tribunal would have no
jurisdiction ratione temporis with respect to Apotex’s allegation in its Pravastatin Notice of
Arbitration that the FDA’s letter decision of 11 April 2006 (determining that the 180-day
exclusivity period had not been triggered) itself constituted a violation of NAFTA Articles
1102, 1105, and 1110. This particular claim would therefore fall to be dismissed on this

basis in any event.

OVERALL CONCLUSION ON PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

It follows that both the Sertraline and Pravastatin Claims must be dismissed in their
entirety, on the basis that Apotex does not qualify as an “investor”, who has made an
“investment” in the U.S., for the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139, and the

Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction.

2 See e.g., Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2, para. 19 (31 May
2005), recognising the United States’ view that claimant “of course, may refer to facts that predate [the three-year
limitations period] as background for its claims... .”

337. Even if Apotex did qualify as an “investor”, who has made an “investment” in the U.S. for

the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139:

(a)

(b)

all claims within Apotex’s Pravastatin Claim that the judicial acts of the D.C.
District Court and the D.C. Circuit breached Articles 1102, 1105, and 1110 of the
NAFTA would have to be dismissed in any event, on the basis that Apotex has
failed to exhaust all local judicial remedies, and the Tribunal therefore lacks
jurisdiction ratione materiae in relation thereto, or alternatively the said claims

are inadmissible; and

Apotex’s claim in its Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration that the FDA’s letter
decision of 11 April 2006 itself constituted a violation of Articles 1102, 1105, and
1110 of the NAFTA would have to be dismissed in any event, on the basis that

the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis in relation thereto.

COSTS

ALLOCATION OF Costs

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides in part as follows:

“1, Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in
principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal
may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred
to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear
such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines
that apportionment is reasonable.

ber

The Respondent is clearly the successful party in both arbitrations before this Tribunal. It
has established each of its three preliminary objections, and secured the dismissal of both

the Sertraline and Pravastatin Claims in their entirety.

In the circumstances, pursuant to the general principle in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL
Rules, the Tribunal considers that the costs of both arbitrations, including the Respondent’s

costs of legal representation and assistance, must be borne by Apotex.

In its written submission on costs, Apotex has argued that should the Tribunal dismiss its
Sertraline and Pravastatin Claims at the jurisdictional stage, it should order that the costs of
arbitration associated with the Respondent’s Objections to Jurisdiction (excluding costs of
legal representation) be equally allocated amongst the Parties, and refuse to apportion any

legal fees — thereby leaving the Parties as they currently stand with respect to costs, fees

Page 112 of 120

and expenses. This was justified by reference (inter alia) to the disposition on costs in the

Loewen arbitration,”"' and on the basis that leaving costs where they lie here:

“~. . would be entirely reasonable, particularly given the purportedly ‘novel
questions of far-reaching importance,’ as asserted by the Respondent, raised
in Apotex’s Claims, and the efficient and professional manner in which
Apotex conducted the arbitration at all times. Such an Award also
eliminates the risk of discouraging future investors by avoiding placing
additional constraints on their access to justice under NAFTA.”

342. The issues in this case, however, were less complex, and less novel, than those in Loewen.
Apotex conducted both arbitrations in an efficient and professional manner, but the fact
remains that it initiated two sets of proceedings against the Respondent, and thereby caused
the Respondent to incur costs, in circumstances where neither proceeding was within the
scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, and no claim was properly before this Tribunal. The
Respondent has raised entirely appropriate objections, and on the basis of the Tribunal’s
findings, ought never to have been embroiled in this process. In all the circumstances, the
Tribunal sees no justification for the Respondent to bear any of the costs it has (reasonably)

incurred.

(B) | ASSESSMENT OF Costs

343. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides in part as follows:

“The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term

‘costs’ includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with

i. The Respondent’s Costs of Legal Representation and Assistance

The Respondent has claimed costs in relation to these two arbitrations in the total amount

of US$ 705,814, which it describes as an “exceptionally conservative” quantification.

This figure includes US$ 180,000 in respect of the Respondent’s half share of the total
advances to cover the Tribunal’s fees and reimbursable expenses (as to which, see below).

Aside from this amount, the balance of US$ 525,814 comprises the following elements:

(a) US$ 498,575 in respect of attorney and paralegal time;
(b) USS 13,750 in respect of expert consultant advice; and

(c) US$ 13,489 in respect of contractor paralegal services.

The Tribunal has carefully considered this claim, together with the detailed evidence and
statements filed in support, and concludes that each element is reasonable, and ought to be

reimbursed in full by Apotex.

Attorney and Paralegal Time: As explained by the Respondent in its written
submissions on costs, unlike their counterparts in the private sector, attorneys and
paralegals in the U.S. State Department’s Office of International Claims and Investment

Disputes do not bill for their time by matter or hour (given that there is only one client).

350.

The Respondent has therefore estimated the amount of time devoted to these two
arbitrations. This has been done by way of a careful exercise, as explained in detail in a
written statement by Mr. Patrick Pearsall (an Attorney-Adviser who played a major role in
the Respondent’s team throughout the proceedings) and a written statement by Ms Mary
Reddy of the Office of the Executive Director in the U.S. State Department’s Office of the
Legal Adviser (detailing annual salary and benefits information for all individuals
concerned). By way of summary, the Respondent has multiplied the cost of each
individual’s salary and benefits for a given year by the estimated percentage of time that

individual spent on both arbitrations in that year.

The Tribunal is satisfied that this is an appropriate methodology, and satisfied that the
exercise has been conducted properly. In particular, given the nature of the issues that
needed to be addressed in the course of these proceedings; the division of responsibility
between different members of the Respondent’s legal team; and the procedural steps
involved between the inception of each case in 2009, and the hearing in 2012, the Tribunal
considers that the overall amount of time spent by the Respondent’s team, and the rates

that have been applied to each individual, are reasonable.

The Tribunal notes in this regard, as pointed out by the Respondent, that the total claimed
excludes (a) the time of several senior attorneys within the U.S. State Department’s Office
of the Legal Adviser who reviewed drafts and participated in meetings for this matter; (b)
the time of attorneys at the FDA and other federal agencies such as the Office of the U.S.
Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Commerce, the
Department of Justice, and the Department of the Treasury; (c) the time of various
administrative personnel. Further, the Respondent has claimed only for its out-of-pocket

cost for attorney and paralegal time, as opposed to the market value of such services.
Expert Consultant Advice: The Respondent retained Prof. C. Scott Hemphill (a

consultant in U.S. pharmaceutical law, then of Columbia Law School) to assist it in this

matter. The Tribunal considers that the costs claimed in this regard are reasonable.

355.

Contractor Paralegal Services: The Respondent contracted with IE Discovery, Inc.,
to provide paralegal services for the February 2012 hearing (because the Respondent’s own
internal paralegal assigned to these arbitrations left in 2011). The Tribunal considers that

the costs claimed in this regard are reasonable.

Conclusion: It follows that Apotex must reimburse the Respondent in the total amount

of US$ 525,814 in respect of the latter’s costs for legal representation and assistance.

ii. The Tribunal’s Fees and Expenses / ICSID Administration Costs

Article 39 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides in part as follows:

“1, The fees of the arbitral tribunal shall be reasonable in amount, taking
into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject-matter, the
time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the
case.
LP
Paragraphs 13 and 14 of Procedural Order No. | provided as follows (by agreement of all

Parties):

“Vv. FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL
(ARTS 38 AND 41 OF THE UNCITRAL RULES)

13. The arbitrators will be remunerated in accordance with the ICSID
Schedule of Fees.

14. The arbitrators’ disbursements shall be reimbursed in accordance with
ICSID practice...”

Pursuant to Article 40(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal hereby fixes the following
amounts in respect of its fees and expenses, and ICSID’s charges and expenses for the

administration of both arbitrations:

Total Tribunal’s fees and expenses: US$ 233,658.94

Page 116 of 120

comprising:

Mr. Toby Landau QC: Fees: US$ 113,298.75
Expenses: US$ 23,594.40

Mr. Clifford Davidson: Fees: US$ 63,990.00
Expenses: US$ 2,411.04

Judge Fern Smith: Fees: US$ 25,875.00
Expenses: US$ 4,489.75

Total ICSID charges and expenses:?°” US$ 44,204.68
Total: US$ _277,863.62

(Cc) SUMMARY

356. Pursuant to two requests made by ICSID on behalf of the Tribunal (dated 15 October 2010
and 24 August 2011 respectively), each Party deposited a total of US$ 180,000 with ICSID
on account of the fees and reimbursable expenses of the Tribunal. The unused balance will
be refunded to the Parties by ICSID in equal shares (reflecting the proportion in which the

advances were received).

357. Apotex must therefore reimburse the Respondent as follows:

(a) US$ 525,814 in respect of the Respondent’s costs of legal representation and
assistance; and

(b) 50% (i.e. the Respondent’s share) of the Tribunal’s and ICSID’s total fees,
charges and expenses, as notified by ICSID to the Parties within 90 days of the
dispatch of this Award.

*® The total costs of the proceeding provided by ICSID include an estimate of the courier services expenses for

sending the certified copies of the Award as well as estimates for the printing and binding costs of the Award.
Therefore, the total amount of the actual final costs will likely be subject to a slight variation. A financial statement
will be provided by ICSID when the account for this case is financially closed and notified to the Parties within a
maximum of 90 days from the dispatch of the Award to the Parties.

VII. OPERATIVE ORDER

358. In the light of the above considerations the Tribunal hereby unanimously Orders and

Awards as follows:

(a)

(b)

Apotex does not qualify as an “investor”, who has made an “investment” in the

U.S., for the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139, and accordingly both

the Sertraline and Pravastatin Claims are hereby dismissed in their entirety, on the

basis that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in relation thereto.

Even if Apotex did qualify as an “investor”, who has made an “investment” in the

U.S. for the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139:

Apotex has failed to exhaust all local judicial remedies with respect to all
claims within its Pravastatin Claim that the judicial acts of the D.C.
District Court and the D.C. Circuit breached NAFTA Articles 1102,
1105, and 1110, and the said claims would therefore have to be dismissed
in any event on the basis that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione
materiae in relation thereto, or alternatively that the said claims are

inadmissible; and

Apotex’s claim in its Pravastatin Notice of Arbitration that the FDA’s
letter decision of 11 April 2006 itself constituted a violation of Articles
1102, 1105, and 1110 of the NAFTA would have to be dismissed in any
event, on the basis that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis in

relation thereto.

(c)

Pursuant to Article 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, Apotex shall bear the
costs of these arbitrations, and shall reimburse the Respondent in the following

amounts:

i. USS 525,814 in respect of the Respondent’s costs of legal representation

and assistance; and

ii. 50% (i.e. the Respondent’s share) of the Tribunal’s and ICSID’s total

fees, charges and expenses, as notified by ICSID to the Parties within 90
days of the dispatch of this Award.
